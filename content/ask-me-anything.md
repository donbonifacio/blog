# Ask me anything

You may ask me anything you'd like about engineering management. I will group
these questions and will release AMA posts with them. To register a question you
can go to this Github issue and leave your question as a comment:

* https://github.com/donbonifacio/blog/issues/108

If you'd rather ask something in private, please use the contact options on the
bottom of the page.

Here's the list of previous [AMA](/categories/ama/) posts:

* [Ask me anything](/post/ama1/) - Sep 2018

You can also check [other
interviews](/categories/interviews/) I've done to other people.
