# Privacy

This website is mostly about providing content Engineering Management. I don't gather user information
and logins, I don't support comments, I don't have cookies to track anything. Even so I do integrate with
other sites and services that do. Mainly I have a integration with [Google
Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to have some statistics about the visitors of the site. I do follow
the advised guidelines on minimizing required information. For example, the
user IP is anonymised. This means that I can see what people are doing on the
site, but I can't associate usage patterns to specific users.

I may also embed content from other sites on my posts: videos from Youtube,
or tweets from Twitter. When I can, I disable the tracking on those
integrations.

I generate my website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) and follow
their [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
guidelines](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/).

## Mailing list

Users can [subscribe to my mailing list](/subscribe/). The email is required
and will be stored on my [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) account. I do have access
to those emails but I hereby promise I won't sell them or use them out of
context.

It is possible to unsubscribe at any time.

MailChimp will automatically send a monthly email with all the posts that I
published during that time. I may also send other emails, but they will be
related with the topic of the site.

## Affiliate links

I may have links and references to products where I specify an affiliate link.
This means that if you go from this site to the referenced product, they will
have a reference back and will know where people come from. This may allow me to
receive commissions on sold items.
