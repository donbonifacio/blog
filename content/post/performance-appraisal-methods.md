Is assessing performance important? We usually have performance reviews tied up
with end of year bonuses and promotions. I tend to focus more on performance
towards continuous improvement. If we have a _template_ of what we should
accomplish and how to add value and we can see if we're on track we can adjust
and improve.

I believe that performance talk should be held at
[1on1s](/post/1on1-framework/). We should not wait for the end of the year to
give feedback and a score. We should have a continuous process for [leveling up](/post/leveling-up-developers/)
people.

# What's the source of bad performance?

We may associate bad performance with low
[productivity](/post/productivity-index/), or not doing the things
right, or completely misbehaving. We point the finger to _bad_ employees and expect
them to make corrections. But I believe that there's much more to it. The
leadership should be responsible to address the _root causes_ for bad
performance. And this means assessing the responsibility of bad performance. And
this may not be fully on the employee's shoulders.

We should focus on how _we_ can overcome hard times together.

## Reason 1: Lack of skills

We may not have the required skills to perform our tasks. This can happen
because of several reasons. For example we may start a _different_ position and
need to deal with unknown technologies or processes. We may be lagging behind
because we haven't had the time to do proper training.

Sometimes we don't have the resources to provide training and will hope that
people will just catch the train running. If that's the case we should provide a
safety net. But we need to be concious on that and try to provide a proper
[onboarding](/post/onboarding-template/) material that allows for quicker
ramp-up.

I do think that this is a great opportunity for self growth. Being on this
sittuation will allow us to leave our [comfort
zone](/post/comfort-zone-index/) and _force_ us to [learn new things](/post/learning-index/).

But it's an investment that will _hurt_ short-time
[productivity](/post/productivity-index/). It's both the
responsibility of the employee and of the company/management to overcome this
issue.

## Reason 2: Lack of motivation

We may have high-performers that are not delivering as expected, simply because
they're not motivated. This may be because they're not liking their current
tasks or because they have no sense of purpose. Or even because they're not
connecting with their team.

We need to detect the situation and act on it. Indeed sometimes we have to
perform dull tasks, and that's part of the job. But we need to be aware that
without good challenges and a healthy team, it will be harder to take the most
out of some people.

We need to inspire and motivate. And this may be very hard. But it's important
to understand if this is the problem. Because this may result in high-performers
leaving.

In this situations I believe the main responsibility is on the
company/leadership. We need to have a inspiring vision and goals that challenge
us.


## Reason 3: Misfit

We may have someone that simply isn't a fit. And this should be completely the
responsibility of the company/leadership because we failed on the recruiting
phase. It could be because the person is at a lower level (and even at a much
higher level). It could be because we have different beliefs and values and have
a culture mismatch. It could be some adaptation issue.

We need to figure out how to integrate them or how to help them on finding a new
job. And we need to review our recruitment process on how to improve our match
making.

## Reason 4: Bad processes

Long build times, lots of meetings, etc. This will usually impact _everyone_ but may
be more troublesome for people that have more issues organising themselves. We
may have people that use the wait times to advance on other tasks. But that
multitasking may not be easy and may be harder to do.

We can also have people that are more _optimised_ to do some parts of the
processes. We should understand these strengths and weaknesses and try to take
the most out of everyone.

## Reason 5: Personal issues

Sickness, a small child, problems at home, etc. From time to time we all have our
personal issues that impact our work's productivity. In a healthy environment the
team should have each other's backs and help.

We need to help our teammates overcoming these hard times.

## Reason 6: Bad teamwork

This may be very specific to some teams and cultures. We may have people that
are very skilled and productive _by themselves_ but don't contribute to the
team's output (see [team speed versus developer
speed](/post/developer-speed-versus-team-speed/)). We may also have people that
are _toxic_ and that lower the team's output.

While these people may be _great_ for short time bursts of productivity, they
have a severe impact on long term productivity and may cause other people to
leave.


# How can we measure performance?

There are a lot of causes for bad performance. But how do we _know_ that we're
at the face of bad performance? It would be great to have some [engineering
KPIs](/post/software-engineering-kpis/)
that would just communicate that. But it's very hard to map the influence of
people on the overall productivity.

I believe that the best way is to properly communicate expectations. We all have
some idea of what _good performance_ looks like in our head. We may have someone
that is a _template_ and we measure all other people against that one person.
It's important to understand what we really value and try to communicate that
clearly. And this may be hard.

For example:

* We want _good_ estimates and deliveries on time
* We want good quality deliverables with [few bugs](/post/zero-bug-policy/)
* Be a good teammate
* We expect that some side tasks are also done and that they won't impact the
  main deliverables
  * Reviewing pull requests
  * Write [RFCs](/post/rfc-driven-development/) before starting tasks
  * Present process [improvement suggestions](/post/decision-logs/) from time to time
  * Attend priority bugs that may come up
  * Interview candidates

We could try to _quantify_ some of these things. But that's a slippery path. We
may have someone that only did one pull request with one line of code in one
week, not attending anything else, and that added huge value.

The truth is that most measuring techniques we can use may not be useful at all.
And we may rely on our _six sense_. But the problem is that sometimes we don't
have all the context, and may be unfair when evaluating.

## Peer evaluations

A good approach may be to _query_ the employees peers. Again we may have some
lack of context, but we'll have more information. Usually information that we
totally missed because of some private interactions.

The team always knows who's pushing further and who's lagging behind. And if
someone is producing a lot but having a bad impact on the team.

## Manager evaluations

If the company/manager may be responsible for bad performance, we should also
try to assess it and improve on it. Many times we focus on low performance of
developers like this a problem that _they_ have. And it may be. But we need to
held the leadership accountable. It's the manager's job to grow and motivate the
team. If that's not happening we need to do something about it. Just like we
need clear expectations for developers, we also need it for managers.

Having the team evaluating the manager can be a good source of improvement
points.

# Setting clear expectations

It's great if we're able to communicate our expectations to our teammates. I
find this to be very hard. The best way I found of doing this is just putting
out what's on my mind and discuss it on 1on1s.

It's important to have an agreement on this. It's not that useful if I expect
something from a developer but that's not seen as important from the developer.
So I try to be very blunt and direct and I ask if we have an agreement. This may
led to a healthy discussion.

For example I've seen people working hard on less priority tasks that add value but
are not their main thing to deliver. And the main thing gets delayed. They may
believe that they're adding a lot of value but the stakeholders may have a
different idea. And this results in [recognition issues](/post/recognition-index/).

It's important to have a relationship of trust beforehand. From my experience
people tend to accept improvement points in a more _productive_ way when they
_know_ that the other person has their best interest in mind.

Having these conversations periodically is great because we can adjust the
direction when needed. I usually focus 1on1s on this, but we can also consider
team retrospectives for it.

The main point is that, if we do have an end of year review, there should be no
surprises at that point.


# What's the end goal?

We need to always be iterating on improvement points. This is what makes us
grow. We do need to be concious on the root problems and address them. We need
to be direct and honest and communicate clearly what's on our mind. This is why
I try never to ask for _feedback_ about myself. I always ask for improvement
points. This always makes the other person switch how they communicate. They may
feel more comfortable on giving harsh feedback and if don't have any they may
take the time to think about it.

Then we should work together, as a team, on overcoming issues. This should be a
joint effort. I do believe that developers should be more proactive in their own
evaluations. For example, imagine that a developer comes to the manager and
says: _"Hey, I want to have a 30% pay raise in X years. What's required to
achieve that?"_

This could put the manager on a hard spot. Because it's hard to actually
quantity these things. We may have progression ladders that have time intervals.
But asking beforehand and having a specific set of goals or achievements would
be very efficient to make people grow.

So when I'm on the manager side I try to do the exercise of thinking to myself
of what would be required for my mentee to accomplish so that a X% pay raise is
possible. What do I need to be able to sell that _upstream_?

This forces me to try to quantify things. And it's an ongoing challenge.

# Summary

The title says "Performance appraisal methods" but I end up without such methods
listed. The truth is that I never saw anything that worked really well. But have
seen lots of ways that don't work. My focus is always to grow people make them
more productive and valuable. But I'm still learning this skill. :)
