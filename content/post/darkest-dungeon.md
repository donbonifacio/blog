I don't consider myself a gamer, but I like to play some games from time to
time. I usually like games where I need to manage a squad, that have tactical
and strategic depth. Sometimes I say that this helps me being a better manager.

It's not that in my day-to-day affairs I gain from the experience of leading
virtual heroes to battle. But I do face new and _weird_ challenges on those
games, and sometimes I can correlate to the real world.

# Darkest dungeon

I'm currently playing [Darkest Dungeon](https://www.darkestdungeon.com/), and
it's amazing what this _dark_ game forced me to play as. This is a game where we
need to lead heroes to _dark_ dungeons, filled with terror. A main mechanic of
the game is _stress_. Heroes will suffer stress on performing these missions.
They may gain afflictions or even die by a heart attack if they reach the
maximum stress level.

We'll need to take care of that stress, by investing money and taking care
of them on proper city facilities. We may also train them and improve their
tools.

# Darkest manager

It's impressive how the game _forces_ the player to be a ruthless manager. While
I always try to be a good manager to my virtual team, the game mechanics
made me summon my bad side. Specially then the game made me realise the
following:

**In this game, people are the less expensive resource**.

Every week we have low level recruits (trainees) and it costs nothing to hire
them. It does cost to send them to missions, to train them or to give them
better tools. But without any investment I can already take value from them.

I can get 4 fresh recruits and send them to a mission right away. They will gain
super stress and will struggle. Probably some will get killed. Hopefully not all
of them because that will make me lose my earnings. So I invest very little
and I have good returns. I can even send them with less food and less torches. By
starving and having to do the mission in the dark, they'll gain even more
stress, but the game makes sure that I gain more treasures.

The ones that survive and bring me treasures will probably have a huge stress
level and will need to go to the city facilities that handle that. But that
costs money. So here is the kicker: I just dismiss them.

Some of them will actually get through and level up and be better, even if I
don't invest anything in them. But when they reach a specific level, they will
reject performing tasks of lower levels. The only way for me to take dividends
of them is if I invest in making them better to take them to harder missions.

But because the game limits the amount of heroes I can have, this means that if
I don't have a steady stream of recruits that grow to retirement or die, I won't
have space for these hard working heroes. I'll need to dismiss them also.

And what do I gain from this? Money. With money earned from squeezing these
heroes I improve my city facilities. And I can invest in making a select set
of heroes better, to be able to go on missions on harder dungeons.

# Summary

All this is about heroes and dungeons but we can correlate it with the real
world. It's funny how the game leads the player to be this way. It could have
added some mechanics to balance this a bit. For example, if my city started to
have a bad reputation, and if the stream of candidates decreased... that would
force the player to invest in taking care of the heroes. The player could not
afford to have that level 3 hero that was never trained and was dismissed,
going to _glassdor_ and leaving a bad review. Saying that I sent them to very stressful missions with little food and bad
tools. And that I earned a lot and didn't invest in the hero at all.

Or the stress from the trainees could somehow also affect the stress from the
main heroes. It's like when we have a team or some people that are toxic and
contaminate the rest.

And that could make for the higher level heroes, the ones that are very
valuable, to just leave. That would be a hard blow to my finances.

But hey, it would be just a matter of time. I'd fetch more trainees and restart the
loop.
