These are my replies to my first AMA (ask me anything).

It's interesting how
this made me think and clarify many ideas. I've left the AMA format open and
added the [Ask me Anything](/ask-me-anything/) page that has instructions on how
to receive more questions.

On this interview I give my opinion on several topics regarding engineering
management, problems I've faced and how they changed me, how to measure
performance, how to organise my time and about leadership.

### Nuno: What is, for you, an Engineering Manager?

I see engineering management as a progression from a team leader. In fact many
times EMs are team leaders or tech leads, but with some responsibility shifts.
It's more about the people and outcomes and less about technology. As an
engineering  manager we need to:

* Train people
* Motivate people
* Deal with the fact that we'll be interruped **all the time** :)
* Focus not only on our teams' outcomes but also on the success of the teams
  we interact with

This means responsibilities in other areas like onboarding, recruiting, customer
success, product management, etc. But I'd say that the biggest focus is on
mentoring and growing the team, and making sure that they are motivated. **If a
team leader delivers features, an EM delivers healthy teams that deliver features**.

### Nuno: I'm a new at the Engineering Manager role. What should be my main concerns since day one?

A new engineering manager will be in that sittuation where he/she will be able to
perform the team's work better than the team. But that won't scale. The EM will
need to change the focus. This was my biggest challenge. Okay, I can deliver
features with with quality. But how can I train a team to deliver features
_better_ than I would?

This means more mentoring and teaching and less hands on code. I do think an EM
needs to be hands on, and be technically proficient. But focus on growing people
means that we need to focus less on sprint commitments.

My first struggle was actually the one-on-ones part. I never did them and I
didn't know how to do them. I saw several articles but I didn't quite relate.
Ultimatly I ended up grabbing several pieces of advices and come up with my
one-on-one framework.

When I started as an EM I also did something that helped me a lot. I managed to
_book_ one on ones with people from other areas. With the heads of product,
human resources, etc. This allowed me to learn a lot about those areas and
understand how I could have a bigger impact.

Do find mentors and try to take the most out of them.

### Ricardo: What was your toughest decision so far and what made you decide one way or the other?

I don't recall any situation where I consciously had a hard decision to make.
I do recall lots of bad decisions. There was one time I was _promoted_ to a team
leader and I had a great team. One of my teammates was someone that was super
social. He was that guy that everyone liked and that was bringing a lot of good
vibes to the team. He was also very technically proficient and always had ideas
and pushed us to be better.

But when I started leading him I started to notice that his productivity was
very lacking. He could be the less productive developer we've had. At a given
point I was sometimes covering for him. I didn't know how to handle this and
honestly this started to have a snow ball effect. I started to change the way I
interacted with him, being less friendly and not being able to share what was
bothering me. He on the other hand started to understand that something was off.

At some time I started to confront him, in a way that was not the best.
Eventually our relation started to become toxic. So toxic that I got sick to my
stomach just with the idea of interacting with him. All this was just between us,
somehow we managed to leave the rest of the team on the side.

So my bad decision was hoping that things would fix themselves, instead of
actually facing the problem and acting on it. Looking back, if on one hand he
might have been less productive, I definitely could have taken so much more out of him
if I properly took advantage of this other strengths. I still regret the way I
acted on this, and to this day I still review in my mind what would be the best
way to deal with this problem.

### José: Engineering Manager, Project Manager, Tech/Team Leader. Great titles that convey great responsibility. In your opinion, what do they represent and what are your advices to people who would like to reach them?

On the first question I talked about what it means to be an engineering manager,
so I'm missing project manager, tech lead and team lead.

The **team leader** may be the most senior person on the team. Or maybe someone with lots
lots of context. The team leader will have responsibilities in the deliverables. Is
the team delivering on time? Are the delivered artifacts with quality? Is the
code base easy to change and adapt? Are we adding value? When things go wrong,
it's the team leader that needs to step up and deal with team. The team leader
should have a vision and goal for the team, and should lead the team there.

A **tech lead** is someone that can deliver a feature from start to finish. Can
be responsible for the design phase (like writing the RFC), writing the code,
managing dependencies, 
ensuring quality, deploying the feature and assure it's being used with success.
Sometimes the tech lead and the team leader are the same person. But my personal
style is very different though. As a team leader I believe that _everyone_
should be a tech lead, even the rookie developer. Empowering a rookie developer
to deliver a feature end to end is great for the rookie's motivation and sense
of recognition. And if the feature is tricky, we can add a seasoned developer as
a sidekiq for help and mentoring.

The **project manager** is someone more focused on tasks, deadlines and
dependencies. Assuring that eveyrthing is going according to plan and dealing
with problems that may arise. Will deal with clients and manage the expectations
of multiple parties. The PM will be a JIRA/trello/etc master (?) and will have the
tools to understand where the team is at, and help with planning. Now allow me
to be somewhat controverse here: I do believe that if this is what the PM is
doing, we're not taking the most out of the PM and that the team is lacking. In
my opinion, we take the most value of a project manager if his/her main focus is on
forecasting.

If you want to reach a specific role my advice is to start doing it now. Empower
yourself, start to do the role's tasks, get one-on-ones with a good mentor for
that role, start reading books about that role. Set a goal and a training plan
to get there. Ask your line manager for help.

### Paulo: As an Engineering Manager, how do you balance your time between technical issues and people stuff? Do you split 50/50? Or do you spend more time on tech? Or more time with people (coaching, 1on1s, etc.)?

That depends on the maturity and the size of the team. A team with less
experienced developers means that we need to be more hands on. We need to take
care of loose ends and help with the deliverables. As the team grows in size and
proficiency, we won't need to have code commitments and we'll need to focus more
on training them and motivating them. It's hard to balance all this and things
are always changing.

I'll tell you what's my ideal comfort zone:

* I don't have any deliverable commitments
* I have some code project that is not related with delirables but that adds
  value somehow. For example improving the CI pipeline, some refactoring or
  performance improvement. This allows me to be up to date on the coding part
  but not having the stress of a deadline
* I review all the pull requests of the team. From the frontenders, backenders
  and quality engineers. This gives me a broader perspective of what's happening
  and I can influence things if I need to. This also gives me a lot of context
  to be a better mentor on my one-on-ones because I can detect improvement
  points
* I'm available for something urgent that might came up, like a bug or some
  patch, not needing to switch the context of a developer for it
* I'm always ready to be interrupted. If I don't have a feature to deliver I
  don't need huge blocks of focus and I can be more available
* If some feature is behind, I can step in and help when needed
* I perform one-on-ones and focus on having a plan to challenge and grow the
  team
* I focus more in proactive tasks and try to have a clear picture of the next 3
  months of development

### Ygor: How do you measure your projects performance and success?

This is something that I find very hard to do, and never did see it done in a
way that worked. Some teams talk about SCRUM's velocity for this. But I think
this velocity is more about capacity planning. I mean, we can assess how much a
team is able to deliver, but we can't compare the delivery speed of two teams.

I may have a sense of how things are going. But it's hard to take that to
numbers. In Accelerate they present statistic evidence of several factors that
are associated with high performers. And I'm completely aligned with their
findings. But they actually invest a chapter explaining why gathering this kind
of information via surveys is better than doing it with measurable automatic
data.

So, I can have a sense of how's our delivery speed is going, but I can't come up
with a framework/process that gives me those numbers periodically. Maybe too
much unknowns on our area. :)

But I do struggle with this. There are things that I pay attention too:

* Ping pong between developers and support/quality. Are we delivering things
  with defects?
* How hard are change requests to be implemented? Is our code easy to change or
  do we need to invest a lot in maintenance?
* How much time to developers allocate to things not related with their tasks
  (meetings, interviews, reviewing pull requests and RFCs).
* Are we doing things that are not used? Let's try to have the _whys_ before
  starting development.
* Do we have a clear picture of the future? If we do, we'll be able to build
  code today that is better suited to be changed tomorrow.

All this maps indirectly to software quality and developer proficiency. But
lately I've been aware of something that is even more important. When developers
work on something they start to gain context and learn more. So they start
creating abstraction layers. This makes them more effective. In time we'll have
many indirection layers. So the bigger challenge here will not be a technically
one, but rather it's related with **learning**.

How can we make sure a team is aware of everything that is happening? And when
new developers join the team, how can we make sure that they are up to speed
faster?

So, to finish this up, let me say that I have a simple test that I use to assess
a team's performance, that tries to bundle all this. It's very simple: **could
someone new to the team, perform a small patch, touching 2-3 files, and deliver
it to production _without_ being reviewed?**. Would the team be comfortable
with that? I call this the Commit Challenge Roulette.

To have confidence in saying yes, we'd need to:

* Have a simple code base that can be easily changed and mimicked
* Have standard practices that everyone follows, that influence the newcomer
  to write code _in the same way_
* Have a build system that tests the project with good coverage. If the newcomer
  leaves some
  mistakes, will the build system catch it? How confident are we in that?
* Automatically deploy to production
* Easy way to rollback if something bad was really introduced :)

> [Monika's interview](/post/coach-interview-monika-wojtasinska-felicio/)

### Monika: Do you consider yourself as a leader?

That's a tricky question. I don't believe in self-proclaimed leadership. I
believe that we are leaders if the ones around us see us that way. I do think
that there are things that make up leaders and I do try to achieve them and I
_want_ people to consider me a leader. I just have to work every day to achieve
and maintain that status.

For me, being a leader is about having a vision and the courage/resourcefulness
to take a group of people in that direction. It's about motivating and inspiring.

Regarding myself, I tend to lean more towards a transformational leadership
style.

### Monika: What do you think makes someone a good leader?

In my opinion there are two things that good leaders are good at:

* When things are going wrong, they are able to turn the ship around
* When things are going well, they able to push them to another level

These points translate to added value and are a bit generic. I believe we need
experience as leaders and a diversity of problems and situations to test us.
This allow us to grow and better handle all types of scenarios. And for that we
need time in the trenches. There is no workaround. Training, books, coaching and mentoring
help, but they're no substitute for experience.

I once had a manager that told me something that got stuck with me: _if you've
been mostly successful as a team leader, it just means that you haven't had a
diversity of experiences that allowed you to fail, and that ends up being a flaw
in your career_.


### Monika: What is your most valuable lesson learned or unforgettable advise that significantly influenced the way you interact with people and do your job?

I tell this story a lot of times on my one-on-ones. Many years ago I was the
typical developer that was very productive and proud of this work, but was
lacking in social skills. I was _promoted_ to team leader and things were going
really well. I focused on my _department_ and make sure things were running
smoothly. Or at least I though so.

One day we were having a retrospective. I don't remember the details but I do
remember that all the leads were there (support, marketing, sales, product,
...). Something went wrong and we were discussing it. Well, not me. I delivered
my part of the bargain. At some point I was actually distracted because nothing
there related to me when someone pointed at me and in a really loud and
emotional way said: **the main problem is that Pedro's attitude is terrible**.

That caught me completely off guard. The technical part could have been ok, but I
was focused on _my silo_ and was not helping other teams succeed. Not only that
but focusing just on the engineering side of things was actually crippling my
peers work.

This was eye opener especially because it was the **second** time I got this
kind of feedback. It made me question my beliefs and at that point something
clicked. I really _understood_ that doesn't matter much if my team is having
good output but it's damaging other teams work. At this moment I started my
transformation into a manager.
