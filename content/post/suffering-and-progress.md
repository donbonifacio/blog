While reading [Atomic
Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) I stumbled
on a phrase that got me thinking on my
[goals](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) as a team leader: **"Suffering is
the source of progress."**

I've worked on several projects where the _suffering_ was seen as usual. It was
so usual that the developers didn't even [question it at
all](/post/project-no-one-wants-to-work-at/). I still see it
happening to this day even on healthy teams and projects. There's this _thing_
that happens that causes suffering somehow, but we're all so used to it that we
just take it as is without questioning.

We may have times where we have more bugs than usual, we may have build times
that are troublesome, and we may even have flaky tests that force us to rerun
those builds. We may have a process that fosters merge conflicts on sizable
features that take some days to overcome. We may have lots of meetings that we
don't feel that bring enough value. We may need to _save_ two days per sprint
for demos and planing and we don't see value in it. We may have parts of the
code that are untested and with bad quality and everyone's afraid of touching that.

The list goes on and on. Each team will have their specific issues on that list.
Sometimes we have people that complain. Sometimes we just feel that it's the way
it is and that we can't do much.

Looking back, I do see how the suffering I had from some practices contributed
for my progress as a developer. There are several practices that I vouch for
that are a direct result of this suffering: [unit
tests](/post/100-percent-test-coverage/), functional programming,
[RFCs](/post/rfc-driven-development/), [zero bug
policy](/post/zero-bug-policy/), etc.

I accept that failure happens but I always push for it not to happen again. I
try to [change my habits when I do something
wrong](/post/bug-that-was-not-our-mistake-except-it-was/) and I'm an advocate
for a [postmortem culture](/post/postmortem-culture/).

I'd say that my main process is actually to make sure that we remove _most_
suffering from the team. This means more focus on [productivity](/post/productivity-index/) and [satisfaction](/post/satisfaction-index/)
and being
[proactive](/post/reactive-proactive-forecasting/) today to prevent suffering tomorrow. So I believe that
with enough time and the right mindset, a team can will reach a sweet spot where
most suffering is minimized.

But _if_ we reach that sweet spot, does that mean that we will stop
_progressing_ as a team and individuals? Because we've lost the _thing_ that
motivated us to be better?

Maybe this is an utopia. Maybe we'll never reach that sweet spot. There's always
code that needs to be improved, even if we just did it 6 months ago. There's
always people joining and leaving the team and that always changes the
_personality_ of the team and the way we tackle problems. There's always some
[deadlines](/post/dealing-with-deadlines/) that will put our processes to the
test. Even if things are going great, we may have that production issue that
brings up performance issues and force us to reconsider our application and our
ways of working. And even if we have a team that is healthy, scaling it has its
own set of problems.

And even if we did achieve a team that had zero problems and suffering, there's
also the part of making sure we keep the discipline and motivation to stay at
that level. And that by itself can be a source of new problems that will cause
their own levels of suffering that will motivate us to make new progress.

My conclusion from all this is that we do _need_ some suffering, and that it's
healthy to have it in _healthy_ doses. It will force us to leave our [comfort
zone](/post/comfort-zone-index/).
This is something that I actually do to
my mentees. I may see them [going on a wrong
path](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/) and let them pursuit it.
But when the problems arise I'll expect them to properly handle the problems and
consider what led them to those issues and how to prevent them in the future.
