![1on1 framework](/img/1on1-framework.png)

Getting the best out of my team is one of my responsibilities. For that I need
personal time with each teammate. But taking the most out of these sessions
can be very hard. So I started to build a framework to help me.

# My one-on-one goals and format

I focus my 1on1s on leveling up my mentees, and also myself in the process. The
goal is to make us better and this will be a joint effort. Usually I don't
know what to do or how to do it. I'll have a period of discovery where I try
to get to know and understand each member of my team.

I typically do my 1on1s every month, in a session of 30 to 60 minutes. I've
seen elsewhere that this might be a very long period. I'm usually very close
to my teammates and work day to day with them. I may also have sprint
commitments and deliverables and by being in the trenches everyday I get to
detect issues and talk about them right away.

This allows me to save the 1on1s just for self improvement. It doesn't mean
that I don't attend to issues if needed. But fortunately I've been able to
handle issues in real time, and then I can use the 1on1s for retrospection,
and most important, for thinking about the future.

The agenda for each meeting is very similar to the following:

* Small talk about the previous month
* Gathering and measuring feedback
* Covering current month's theme
* Homework

Before each meeting I'll create a confluence page with the agenda and share
it with my mentee. This might
also have some external feedback I've gathered elsewhere. This will be a private
document for me and my mentee and we'll have a registered history of all
our sessions.

## Small talk about the previous month

I start asking about how things are going and how was the last month. I usually
already have an idea of it, so I try to focus on things that I may have missed
or things that my mentee may not have shared.

This can be very quick or can actually take the full session if we have
complex issues going on.

It also depends on personalities. There are people that may be more keen
to complain, others that are very quiet and don't like to share that much. I
try to give them space and adapt to their way of being. It's important that
they feel comfortable and safe.

## Gathering and measuring feedback

While receiving feedback, I try to categorise and measure several indexes. I
ask for a 1 to 5 scale on several topics and register them every month. This
allows me to see trends and anticipate problems. The image I have on the start
of this post is an example of gathering data for 6 months.

I have detailed articles about each index:

* [Learning Index](/post/learning-index/)
* [Recognition Index](/post/recognition-index/)
* [Comfort Zone Index](/post/comfort-zone-index/)
* [Productivity Index](/post/productivity-index/)
* [Satisfaction Index](/post/satisfaction-index/)

Not only this allows me to _measure_ some key points, it also allows me to talk
about specific issues. This is very important with more quiet people that don't
talk that much. Going through this topics and trying to understand their
answers always yields a good conversation.

I also split the data in categories like frontend and backend. For example, we
could be in a company that values frontend more than backend. And I also filter
by time at the company. Things like learning and recognition are very different
if we're considering new hires versus people that has been in the company for
10 years.

Note that the scale is from the mentee's perspective. For example: it's hard to measure
how much each one is learning because that depends on the backgrounds and
experiences. But how much each one _feels_ they are learning is
something that I can compare against.

## A theme for each month

I try to have a monthly theme to follow. It can be about peer review, talking
about specific improvement points, discussing team processes, or about
goals and achievements.

This helps me to have a standard plan for all 1on1s. I can prepare and organise
better. It's very important for me because on some months I may be under water
with other deliverables. Also, after some time doing this I start to have some
_standard_ themes that I revisit. This gives me experience on those themes
and allows me to take the most out of my sessions.


### Typical plan for a new team

As an example, I'll share a typical plan when I start working with a new team,
or when someone joins my team.

#### First week review

After the first week I have a small session just to gather feedback and understand
if everything is going well. Usually I ask what people think about our
[onboarding template](/post/onboarding-template) and how can we make the process
better. I also present my framework, the indexes and the goals of our sessions.

#### Month 1: 10x better question

When I start working with someone I don't know much about them, and I try
to discover what makes them tick. Usually I ask the following question:

> Imagine that in 2 years you are 10 times better than today. What does
> that mean, and how to get there?

Usually I don't have straight answers and this becomes homework for the next
month. It's very rare to find someone that can easily pin point where they
want to be and how to get there.

This question makes people consider:

* What does it mean to be that much better? Do I need to improve my technical
  skills? Do I need to learn different skills?
* How can I improve that much? Is that even possible?

For me, the best thing here is to understand what people value. This is specially
important if I'm doing a
session with someone from a different area. I can clearly define a very
experienced backend developer and I can help people get there. But if
I'm coaching a designer, a data scientist, or any other role that I don't
know much about, this will help me a lot.

#### Month 2: Setting goals

On the second month people will have a better idea of how they can improve
and how to get there. Time to set some goals. I believe that goals are very
important so I ask for quarterly goals. I split them into the following
categories:

* **Professional goals**: these are related to our day to day work. We need to
  deliver features or outcomes. I ask them for a commitment on what they
  will deliver on the next quarter
* **Self improvement goals**: I ask for at least one self improvement goal.
  This can be training, going to conferences or reading books
* **Self vision goals**: At least one thing that the mentees would like to add
  to the project. This should be a personal idea and something that hugely
  motivates them. Like doing some refactor or improve some part of the project.
  Doing research on some technology or make processes and tooling better

Each one of these topics can be vague and will generate lots of questions.

#### Month 3: Making the goals SMARTer

On the third month we'll have several goals on the table. But goals by themselves
aren't that useful. They need to be SMART:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time bound

Someone might have a goal of learning Japanese. That's very vague, so I'll ask
if they can set a time limit (for example one year) and what they expect to achieve
on that time frame (having basic fluency). With this in mind it's easier to
understand what they'll need to _invest_ to get there. They can access if if
makes sense and if it is achieavle.

Another example is _delivering features_. I'll push for _delivering features
with quality_. So we need to define what's quality. How can we measure that?

All these topics might be abstract but yield great conversations. Actually,
I'm usually not interested on the goals themselves, but rather on the process
to achieve them. This is where I try to help and where I try to push and
be very demanding.

## What about giving feedback

You may notice that I've talked a lot about _gathering feedback_ and _defining
goals_. But there's another very important topic that I didn't cover: how can
a manager provide meaningful feedback back. This usually comes in the form of performance
evaluations. I think this is a huge topic and I'll cover it on other articles.

But my point here is that as a manager I can't be just asking for things. It's
very important to also provide candid feedback and clearly communicate:

* Strengths and weaknesses
* Productivity
* Impact on the team and on the business

Honestly it's still very hard for me to achieve this. It's work in progressâ„¢.

# Summary

This framework has been working quite well for me and I've gotten good feedback
about it. After an year I can see trends in the indexes and see all the goals
that were achieved. I can look at the data and ask questions:

* How does the learning index correlate with performance?
* What have we as a team done to improve productivity? Does it show?
* Can we correlate some indexes (like learning or recognition) being low with
  someone leaving the company?
* Do setting and delivering more self improvement goals affect the learning
  and comfort zone indexes?
* Can someone be satisfied at the company, but not learning and not feeling
  productive? Do these people end up leaving? How are their performance reviews?
* Do we have some groups of people that have different feedback? Could we
  be responsible for that?
* Do we see and index getting worse, try to change the course and see it
  getting better?

Sometimes I can't get proper answers. Other times I feel that I'm still missing
tools and processes to be better. But that's okay. It's all part of _my_ learning
process.
