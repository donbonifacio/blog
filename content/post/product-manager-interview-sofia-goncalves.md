[Sofia Gonçalves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofia-g-06a9ab50/) is a product
manager currently working for [Resolver](https://www.resolver.co.uk/).

In this
article we talk about what are the responsibilities of a product manager and
what are their biggest challenges (for example, defining priorities).

About what's a good process for product managers and how to deal with partially remote
teams.

We also talk about recruiting and mentoring product managers.

> Hello Sofia. Can you introduce yourself and talk a bit about your background
> and what you do?

Hi :-)

Thanks for the question, happy to be part of this.

I'm Sofia Gonçalves and I'm a Product Manager. Although Portugese, I have lived
in different European Countries and I'm now based in London.

My background is different than what I do now - I used to be a Clinical
Psychologist and studied a lot in that area. Around 5/6 years ago, I realised
that although I learned a lot about people's behaviours and enjoyed my time as a
psychologist, I didn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life. I decided
to change careers. The problem was, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I
enrolled in an MBA program (in ESADE) so that I could expand my knowledge about
business and expand my network.

At the end of my MBA I was trying to get a job, but I wasn't sure in what. One
of my final classes gave me the indication of the industry I wanted to work in -
technology. It is thanks to Prof Luis Vives that I understood of my value and
interest in this industry. I landed in Product management a bit by accident, and
like most, I have learned it by doing it.

I have worked with SaaS product and websites, and have always learned a lot with
the teams I was part of. All of them were quite diverse, which made it fun.

At the moment I work in London for the amazing company
[resolver.co.uk](https://www.resolver.co.uk/) - we help
clients and companies get into a better agreement if there was a disagreement
over a service or product. I deal with a SaaS product, helping small business
grow, by dealing with their own set of clients. I love being here mostly because
it is an amazing team, that respects you and helps you grow, whilst doing
something good for people - we help resolve issues they have with companies. :-)

> So how would you explain what a product manager does? What are your day to day
> tasks and what are you responsible for delivering?

Explaining what a product manager does is always funny, because it is hard to
explain it, if you have not worked in tech. I usually say if I had to explain to
a 5-year-old what I do, they would be disappointed. I don't code, I don't design
or work with social media. And yet, we need to understand a bit of all of those
things. We have to be the ones driving people's work in the right direction and
defend the product's vision, making sure everyone is working towards the same
goal.

Often people say we are like a CEO of the product, but I disagree. Ultimately, I
do not have the final word of what happens to the product - the CEO of the
company does. As a product manager you often are the one talking with different
members of the team, to understand how you can achieve things and solve
problems. The product manager is, indeed, an immense advocate of the users and
their needs, which means we need to be their voice in the company. This can mean
we need to explain to people in the company why certain ideas are not good - we
need to understand how those ideas would actually go against the product's
vision and the users' needs. Other times, the idea is good and we need to
understand how to integrate with the rest of the work being done and how to
prioritise certain features.  I usually say product management is ideal for
people who are problem solvers - that is basically what you do. You try to solve
as many problems as you can, so that the team can work without any blockers.

On a day-to-day (and depending on the company) you are organising other people's
work. This means sometimes working on strategy, looking at Jira boards to help
prioritise tasks and writing requirements of future tasks or talking with users
so you are in touch with their needs. Sometimes this means meetings, other times
just lone work.

It is a fun job, but sometimes it can be frustrating. If you cannot help your
team to move forward you feel you have failed, so a certain stamina is required
to be a product manager. I love it though :-)

> Imagine that there is a feature to be done. From your point of view, what
> would be the best process going for an idea to a deliverable?

I always try to involve the entire team in the process- sometimes that is a
challenge if, like me, half your team is office based and the other half remote.
It changes the dynamic and you struggle to find the best way to collaborate
(although it is not impossible).  I try to understand the idea how actually how
to break it down - sometimes it can be one feature, other times in needs to be
broken down into more. Once I fully understand or at least have as much
information I can get, I will go to development team and discuss it with them.
Although I need to understand how technology works, they are the experts and
understand, for example, the implications in developing something and how it can
affect the rest of the system (and what to do to avoid complications). Once that
has been discussed and agreed as a team, I will go to design/front end team and
with some rough wireframes we will discuss the feature(s). It is here where you
think a lot about the user, UX requirements and how the user journey should be
smooth and not complicated.  Once you have requirements and designs done it is a
question of understanding when it can be done - that has to do with
**priorities**. You, as a product manager, need to understand what has been
agreed to be done before and when you can do this feature. Priorities, usually,
are defined by the user - what their needs are and what makes the user journey
simpler/clearer and closer to the final goal of the same user.  The key to a
good delivery is **collaboration and respect**. Always listen to the experts in
your team and decide how to integrate all of that knowledge, having in mind what
is best for the user.

> Can you share some tips on how to take the best of a team that is partially
> co-located and partially remote?

Some tips:

- **Have the right equipment**. Although it seems obvious, there are things that
  people forget, perhaps because they never had to deal with remote teams.
  Having a good laptop (with camera) for when you have one-to-ones is important.
  A good headset for speaking/hearing is also crucial, because if the team
  cannot hear you properly the communication suffers. For times when a few
  people from each office/remote are joining for a meeting, in meeting rooms at
  the office make sure you have a good sound system, with a good microphone and
  a camera that can capture more than just one person.

- **Make sure communication is via a tool that remote people can access** -
  don't rely on coffee-breaks to convey important information. If for whatever
  reason this happens, inform remote team what happened afterwords.

- **Have a good way to distribute/save documents** - not just email.

- **Have remote team in mind and make them feel part of processes**. Sometimes
  it will be uncomfortable and it might mean a bit more work, but making people
  feel integrated is crucial. If this means to set up a meeting with everyone
  and finding it hard to get a time when everyone is free, so be it.

- **Stop demonizing remote work** - just because people are not in the office,
  they are not dead to the world. There are plenty ways to catch-up. I
  understand some people prefer face-to-face, but you have to accept that is not
  possible with everyone, so use video (instead of just voice meeting or email).

- **Accept that sometimes things will go wrong** - and that is ok. Assess the
  problem, understand it, see a solution, and implement it. Sometimes
  communication will be broken, people will be upset, but know that is normal.
  Be patient and be kind to others and yourself.

- **Understand that half your battles will be about communication and that
  cultural differences matter.** Don't interpret something - either an email or
  a comment - without full context; take a moment and try to clarify it. Whilst
  some cultures take a more careful approach to communication, others are more
  direct. There is no right or wrong, just different ways of working. Make sure
  you are respectful, but also respected :-)

> You said that priorities are defined by the users, but how do you know the

Users are extremely important for a product manager, and by definition you are
the voice of the users, as often there is no one else to "defend them" when you
are deciding what to build next (you will have developers who want to build
things that make more technical sense, but not for users; you will have sales
people who will want to build things the clients wants - and not necessarily
what the user wants; you have finance people who will want to save money).

Before the users, for a product to be really consistent and successful, you have
to have a **product strategy in place**. Otherwise, problems will arise at a
later stage (it is like tech debt - you can ignore it for a while, and
eventually it will become a much bigger problem, that can actually stop you from
developing things you want).  When you decide your product strategy, you define
the problem you are trying to solve, the solution that you have chosen to go
forward with and the steps for it. The solution chosen depends on the company,
on the resources they have and what makes sense for them to do, given the entire
line of products ([this is a link
](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-strategy-bcaa3fda9a31) to an excellent about
strategy).

**So, if you have users asking different things, how do you decide
what to do?** You check your strategy. You see if it aligns with what you are
proposing. It could well be that users want something really different, and if
that is so, one should not go ahead, or be very aware of the risks. Example: an
e-commerce website might have their users ask for a financial payment system.
The company analyses the request and understand that is not aligned with its
strategy - trying to sell products online is different from setting up a
financial payment system. On the other hand, it could be that the company is
trying to grow and diversify, therefore this makes sense. It all depends on your
strategy!

**How do I choose innovation against evolutive maintenance?** This is
probably one of the toughest questions! I think I might not have a satisfactory
answer, because it will depend, and honestly you need to use your common sense.
You should not ignore things that need to be done, that are maintenance, but it
can't be all you do. You should innovate, but understand that if you don't make
space or take care of the underlying system, it will stop you from doing
anything, sooner or later.  As a product manager, you need to make decisions,
what is best for the product, and "arm" yourself with reasons why you decided to
do it: it may be data; or that in order to do X, you need Y; it could be because
that is what the users want; etc.


> How about hiring product managers? What kind of skills should we look for? How
> to distinguish junior from senior product managers?

I always thought that people look for the wrong things - often companies want
someone who has done the same job for years, in the same area, and if they
haven't they reject them. There is little thought put on cultural fit, which
always makes me laugh, because often that is the reason why people leave.

Skills to look for:

- good problem solvers
- mediators
- analytical people
- someone who understands users' behaviour
- patient and adaptable

A good product manager is someone who is a natural **problem solver**. Not to
say people who are not natural problem solvers or mediators will be bad, but the
job will become too frustrating and not enjoyable. Part of a product manager's
responsibility is to make sure the entire team is unblocked to work on the
product - whether it be a designer, developer or content manager. The product
manager needs to make sure their path is clear, and if it is not they need to
understand what the problem is and how they can solve it, by unblocking it.

Product managers need to be the person who often brings the team together -
making sure everyone in the team (or a representative) sits down and talk
through a problem. Often, being a **mediator** is needed to make sure people
understand each other, and the best decision for the product and its users is
made.  **Analytical skills** are essential as you should base your opinions on
the users' needs and behaviours. They need to know how users are using the
product, how they react to a change, etc., therefore understand data well.

**Understanding users' behaviour** is extremely important as a product manager
needs to interpret what users want, what their goal while using the product is.
The product manager is the voice of the user, therefore they need to understand
users well when trying to decide what to do - balancing users' needs needs to
tech debt, clients' needs, management's opinion, etc.  Finally, being a product
manager is dealing with frustration. Often things do not go as expected, and the
product manager needs to bring the team together, give them motivation to go on
and to find an alternative solution. Is not always easy, and sometimes one feels
discouraged, but having a word of encouragement, instead of a defeated attitude
is essential. This will help the product manager to **adapt** to any situation
that comes by.  Some of these characteristics are not specific to product
managers only, but I think product managers have a crucial role in bringing the
team together and motivating people to bring their best selves forward.

Junior and product managers differ in confidence. For the time being, there is
no undergraduate course one can do to become a product manager. The best product
managers I have the pleasure to work with have been developers, business
analytics or lawyers in the past. All of that prior experience is extremely
helpful, in its own way, as it shapes who you are as a product manager. Some
will be better with users, others more technical and others better with
client/user management. We all learn in the job, continuously learning through
others (colleagues or actual short courses about product management). Junior
product managers are just not as confident in making decisions than a more
senior product manager, and potentially has not experienced working with certain
types of products. Nevertheless, having a fresh pair of eyes, someone looking at
something like a clean canvas is amazing and I hope to encourage anyone who
wants to become a product manager to come forward, because I think you have a
lot to offer.


> How an we grow junior product managers? How can we make them more confident?
> What tips can you share on mentoring/coaching product managers?

To be a mentor or a manager/leader is a big responsibility, that not every
person is suited for. Being a mentor is a lot about how to understand people in
their unique way, and help them move forward, within the limits of the company
and job. It is fun and rewarding to be a mentor. You learn a lot about yourself
and your own profession - when you have to teach something, you get to re-learn
it, and in a much more profound way.  To be a good mentor you need to give
honest feedback - do not be afraid to be real. That is the only way one can
truly grow. Claire Lew has amazing posts about leadership - you should check her
posts :-)

The way you can grow junior managers (and let them build their trust) is by
slowly giving them more freedom and responsibility regarding their product. At
first, they will need a lot of support and you will need to explain how things
work and how they are intertwined, but eventually, they will understand and make
their own decisions without being terrified. Letting them make mistakes is also
good; of course, as mentors/leaders, you should avoid letting them make huge
mistakes, but small things are ok. These situations can be a learning
opportunity - you make a mistake, and yet "survive". You learn that it is not
that scary and also what to do in the future. The best learning opportunity lies
in confidence building - the junior product manager understands that even after
doing mistakes one can go on. It is a powerful message of "it is ok to mess up".
Saying that one person will never make a mistake is delusional and, potentially
dangerous, for when that happens they freeze and not able to go on. It is like
learning how to ride a bicycle - don't let the other person take such a fall
they will break a leg or arm, but if they fall and get a scratch it is ok. You
will clean the wound and try again, and again, until they figure it out how to
ride. Be the person who holds the bike in dangerous moments, and also the person
who let’s go when the ride is smoother.

Above all, if you are in a mentorship role be respectful and ensure you pass
that message to your mentee. Be proud of whom these people want to be and help
them take steps to that journey. Seeing people who you have mentored grow and be
successful is one of the best feelings you will have professionally :-)

> Thanks for answering my questions Sofia. As a closing note, can you suggest
> someone else to be interviewed?

Thank you so much for your time and for asking me to interview with you. I had
lots of fun,~thinking about all your questions and how to make it clear to
others. 

I nominate a few people:

- **Cindy Chang** - Senior Product Designer at Intercom
  (https://twitter.com/cindyjchang). I met Cindy at Jam conference last year in
  London and was amazed by her. Being a POC woman in tech is not easy, so I am
  sure she will give you a different perspective than I did. 

- **Dan Kim** - Software Engineer at Basecamp (https://twitter.com/dankim).
  People who work in Basecamp are super interesting and I'm in awe how they work
  in such a competitive market, while being bootstrapped and profitable. Their
  moto is "Work can wait" - Dan lives by this, and remarkably in his spare time
  he works, alongside with other people, in a super cool weather app
  (https://twitter.com/helloweatherapp)

- **Daniel Lopes** - CTO at Know Your Company
  (https://twitter.com/danielvlopes). Daniel is, in reality, a jack of all
  trades. He does it all in Know Your Company. He has an incredible back story
  (but he is very humble, so really ask him what he has done). He has also been
  involved in fighting fake news for the election of Brasil's president. 

- **Mara Zepeda** (https://twitter.com/marazepeda) and **Jennifer Brandel**
  (https://twitter.com/JenniferBrandel) are two fierce ladies who started an
  incredible movement called Zebras Unite (https://twitter.com/sexandstartups).
  This movement is about having ethical and diverse start-ups. I would
  absolutely love to see them share their experience and how they use technology
  to help them in their full-time jobs as CEOs on their individual companies -
  one in journalism - Hearken (https://twitter.com/wearehearken) and the other
  in social community for students - Switch Board
  (https://twitter.com/switchboardhq).

- **Pierre Schambacher** - Software Engineer at Zendesk
  (https://twitter.com/PierreSchambac). It would be interesting to hear his
  views how it is to work in tech in Europe vs USA. He is French and living in
  San Francisco now, so I am sure he has interesting views to share.
