I've know [Tiago Sousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagosousa/) for a really long
time. We were both students at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en/),
we did some classes together and actually ended up doing our thesis together.
We worked at **[Orion's Belt](https://www.onrpg.com/news/orions-belt-interview-back-to-the-roots/)**,
a massive online multiplayer game, and it was one
of the best experiences I had as a developer.

We then started working at [Safira](https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home.html) and 
then moved together to [PDM](http://www.pdmfc.com/) where we
worked on several projects. We later parted ways and each one of us had our
own path.

Tiago is a seasoned developer and currently is working at [Sky](https://www.sky.com/).
He had several team leaders and managers and on this interview I try to understand
what's his opinion on being the best manager.

> Hey Tiago, what can you tell us about what you have been doing at Sky?

My work is a little bit wide, I can do a simple programming feature, but I can
also be evolved in an architectural decisions or even in discussions about 
new approaches to problems.

I'm part of the support team too, so I need to have a pretty good global vision
of all our application. The phone rarely rings, but when it happens I need to
have the ability to look at logs, identify the problem and make decisions if
it's a critical incident and we need to be attack it ASAP, or if it's a problem
in an external
service and we need to contact other teams, or is a simple punctual problem and
can be resolved in the next working day.

Internally I already worked in multiple teams, and in a couple of strategic
projects, with lots of different people so I consider I'm a lucky guy because
almost every day I can learn something new with someone.

> So you've done lots of stuff on several teams, and you also worked with
> several team leaders I'm guessing. What's in your opinion the best and the
> worst traits of team leaders?

I know this is a common expression, but is so true: _"A true leader should
lead by example"_.

A good team leader should take care of the team and help each member to grow.
Each one in its own way. Ensure a good balance between what makes the team happy and
what is required by the business. For example, you can't always ask the team
to make an extra effort to make the business happy, but sometimes is needed.
And a good leader knows how to ask it and knows to reward it, and the reward
doesn't need to be monetary, you just need to recognize the extra effort.

On the other hand a bad leader is the exactly the opposite. But I'll add
something more. Having a leader who you feel he doesn't mind about the project's
direction, who you feel he doesn't trust you or the team, who you feel he is
more worried about himself... for me is a very short way to undermine the 
final result.

> When you say that that a leader should lead by example, how much coding do

> manager that makes the team happier and more productive?

I already had the 2 types of managers, and as a guy how likes technology I
would say that a manager with coding skills it's a nice to have but isn't the most
important. Saying this I think is fundamental to a manager to have a technological
background, otherwise how can he know if something is possible to be done,
or how much time it should take, or how can he defend a point of view
in a meeting?

When I said a leader should lead by example, it means a leader should listen
to all members of the team, should know how to manage conflicts, should put
the boots of each element of the team and the developers who he interact's with,
and feel what they feel. A manager is a manager, is not a developer.

That's my normal. :) :) :)

Jokes aside, everyone have things that likes more than others, if I'm doing
something which I like surely I'll be stimulated do to a good job, to investigate
the best solution. A manager should know each element of the team, so if I
like working with SQL the manager should give me issues with SQL, if my colleague
likes CSS he should have issues with CSS, and so on.

Challenging the team is good too. A manager that knows the product  and have a problem and
challenge the team to find a solution for it, looks like a child play, but it's
a very smart approach which result in every team element starting to investigate,
study, trying to know better the product, the technology and probably will find
some new trends capable of resolving the problem.

Of course. In fact most of the recognition a developer can achieve is
because he's a good communicator, can explain clearly and simply his ideas, is not
because he's a great coder, don't be deceived. I already told to some
colleagues - _"You sell yourself very bad, you are great, but you don't know how
to show that to other people."_. You can't compartmentalise people skills, if you
work with someone you have to live with a good or bad developer, a good or bad
team member, a good or bad friend, and so on, a person must be seen by the
complete package. If you ask me if I prefer to work with a great developer that
is a despicable person, or a average developer which is a great team member,
in a blink of an eye I will pick the second.

Like technical skills, communication skills or other skills, is something you
are born with the predisposition to. Nevertheless you can train them. You can do
soft skill training and have coaching. You can learn reading books, there are
an dozens of ways you can develop your soft skills.

> I definitely agree with you. Thanks for your time answering my questions.

> As a last question, anyone you'd like to suggest for me to interview next?

It was for less than 2 years, but I worked with a young guy who marked me a
lot, I look at him as a model of what I like to have as a team-mate. Is name
is [Manuel Fel√≠cio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelfelicio/), he is really brilliant, and every one around him learned
a lot with him, technically he one of the bests I ever worked, and as a person
he is always available to help everyone. Definitely he is a guy who you want
to know a little more about is professional experience.
