I first met [Ricardo Fiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardofiel/) when I was
taking my degree at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/en/). Then we had different career
paths, but ended up working
at the same company. He was CTO at [RUPEAL](https://www.rupeal.com) and I was
a lead developer.

We worked closely for a couple of years. The most vivid
memory I have of Fiel is that even though we didn't always see eye to eye,
we always had good discussions and were able to overcome obstacles.

I learned a lot with him and at this day I still look up to him for advices
and mentoring.

> Hey Fiel, can you introduce yourself and talk a bit about what you do at
> Microsoft?


Sure. I'm based in Lisbon, currently working for Microsoft as a Cloud Solution
Architect for partners in Western Europe. Which translates to helping partners
envision the art of the possible and build awesome solutions on our Azure
platform using whatever tools and processes they currently have. My day is
usually lots of skype calls, workshops and coding sessions. While I was hired
with a focus on infrastructure, I'm actually now doing more devops, containers,
webdev and even leading a small, unofficial, team around disruptive scenarios
with AI. Outside MS, I'm a dad of 2, rock n roller, really into personal
development and everything about breaking rules and patterns.

> What rules and patterns do you think are essential for your success?
> And how will you break them? :)

Ah, good and tricky question :) The thing is... I'm not a rules person, never
was. One of my favorite things is breaking whatever rules are preventing people
from achieving great things. Back in the day, I was doing college while
recording albums for major labels and playing hundreds of gigs. This was an 
engineering course and I never considered myself and engineer, I hate processes
and detail. Yet I was honored to be awarded best student in that year's class.
There was a lot of rule breaking during that period. :)

I'd rather have strong values. When our set of values are strong and clear, all
decisions are simpler. We know what guides us. We know what we stand for. The
same for a company. We see companies all over the place trying to enforce strict
rules around processes, working hours and behaviours, among other things, yet
employees feel disengaged and unmotivated. If we have a strong set of shared
values, then rules become less necessary.

As for patterns, I'd rather call them habits. Since a couple of years ago I
started practicing rituals around gratitude and time management. That was a
game changer. Gratitude is immensely powerful. I became less fearful of
failure. I don't mind confronting anyone about any topic and always in a
non-violent way. I don't complain and I believe things are great and getting
better. And I think big. I ask myself the question _"how can this have more
impact?"_ often.

> Sometimes we do see companies pushing for values, but employees actually don't
> follow them. What could companies do to actually change that in an
> effective way?

Yes, that's true and, unfortunately, quite common. I believe it starts with
hiring. How many people actually understand what a company stands for before
joining? And, on the other end of the spectrum, how many companies dig deep
into what a person stands for? Not that many. Hiring for the so called
"cultural fit" should be more about finding people that share some, if not all,
of your core values and live those values naturally, regardless of which company
they work for. Ideally, you want to get people that do the extra mile and
actually promote changes to the company culture in way that builds upon
its core values.

Then, it's very different in a small vs a large company. With a small number of
people, it's easy to take a couple of days and have the team discover the values
the company stands for, together with the CEO and management. In a large one,
usually it requires constant feedback from the filed to upper management on how
the company's values and culture are impacting, in good and bad ways, their
daily work. And good companies will listen and promote changes as they see fit.

The one thing I believe most companies could do better is to promote honest
feedback and actually listen to their employees.

> I really liked the way you talked about values and habits. You already talked
> about hiring, but what would be your approach to disseminate those concepts
> in an already existing team?

It must be driven by behaviors from everyone. I'm going to use a concrete
example from Microsoft because 1) I believe it's very good 2) I see it in
action every single day. One of our main [values](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/values)
is innovation. And innovation cannot happen if people are afraid to take risks
and fail. Some years ago Microsoft publicly launched the Tay bot and had to take
it offline after a short while, as the bot was not behaving properly due to
racist comments it learned in Twitter. Satya, our CEO, apparently (I hadn't
joined yet) [sent this](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/02/20/microsofts-satya-nadella-counting-culture-shock-drive-growth/98011388/)
to the team: _â€œKeep pushing, and know that I am with you"_.
His behavior fully aligned with our culture of innovation. It makes me feel
safe to constantly try new things and learn.

Gratitude and non-violent communication are key. Countless times, and for very
diverse topics, I have been in situations of conflict with someone where it
would be easy to let emotions and ego run wild. Before I learned how to use
these tools, if I really wanted something to happen or didn't agree with a course
of action, I'd probably be more aggressive and, most likely, wouldn't reach an
optimal solution. Nowadays, I always listen to people understanding that whatever
course of action they want to take, even if I don't agree, is what they believe
to be right. And what each of us believes to be right or wrong cannot be judged
by someone else who doesn't have the same context and didn't have the same
experiences. I make sure I understand the context behind an opinion that I may
disagree with before. I'm having a very hard time remembering a time where this
didn't work.

As far as time management goes, I'm a huge fan of 2 ways of thinking - Tony
Robbins' RPM methodology and Ricardo Semlers' 7 day weekend. The first because
I always believed outcomes are important, tasks are irrelevant. The latter
because that's how I mostly managed to play 400+ rock gigs while working
full time. I think society is greatly impacted in a bad way by having most people
working Mon-Fri and it's refreshing to see how technology has helped us move away
from that more and more. Just think of the number of hours saved in commute if
more and more people could choose when and where to work.

I did have some bad experiences with RPM over the years as sometimes I was so
focused on the larger goal, on the outcomes, that I actually stopped taking
notes of small things I needed to do (eg: renew some saas service, pay kid's
school, etc...). Which means I may have screwed up some times with that :)
Nowadays I keep a list of small must-do's and I schedule outcomes. So far it's
working very well.

It starts with the end in mind - to ship better, higher quality software,
faster. In a time where companies are moving very fast, shipping dozens or
hundreds of deployments a day, it's dangerous for a company not to be in the
same mindset. We've all seen well known examples of companies who vanished because
they couldn't move innovate and move fast enough. And to be able to innovate and
move fast, companies need to embrace a culture of agility, devops and automation.

I stopped doing slide-based sessions of these topics. Nowadays I find it brings
more value to have whiteboard (physical or virtual) conversations around how
companies are building and shipping software, what are they good at and where
are they struggling. It's a better and more meaningful conversation to use their
own challenges and show how Azure can help improving the pain points without
massively changing everything they do. So I may talk a bit about how it all
starts with culture, with the right mindset. Then the kind of improvements their
process can have (and sometimes I learn a lot from them here), and finally how
some available tooling is a great fit for their scenario. Every conversation is
different, but definitely these topics are common.

Automation and telemetry are topics I like to spend a good deal of time on, as
specially the latter is sometimes ignored. Everything should be automated,
either by using something native like ARM templates or a 3rd party tool like
Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Terraform, etc.. Every human interaction is a potential
mistake. Also, it must be straightforward to redeploy every bit of the
infrastructure and you can't do that without automation.

I'm also glad to see more and more the conversations around serverless. Wether
it's around containers (we have a serverless container offer - Azure Container
Instances), web applications, integrations and workflows and even AI, companies
are realising how these kinds of services can help tremendously in innovating
faster.

> Could you elaborate on the telemetry topic? What's the impact, why is it
> sometimes ignored, and what can we do about it?

There's a common belief that work is done when an app is deployed. But if that
was true, how would teams know how the application is performing? How their
users are using the app? What kind of problems are dormant? I push a lot for
telemetry as part of the CI/CD process to answer these questions. Given the
excellent tooling around today, it's usually less than a minute to set it up.
As an example, Azure has Application Insights which can be automatically
deployed with an app by checking one box. Just by doing that, we'll give you
insights not only on an app's performance (including server and browser),
dependencies and errors but also the behavior the users are having in the app,
including checkout funnels, session analytics and much much more (and it's free).
On top of that, we can setup alerting and be notified of challenges before they
become problems.

Having this kind of info continuously available is what makes it possible to
really understand if an app is successful or not. Some examples of questions that
can be answered with this: how did the last deploy impact the site (performance,
errors and usage)? What is the cpu/mem/disk usage trend and are we expecting
problems soon? If so, exactly where in the app? Do we need to (auto)scale? Are
we oversizing (and overpaying) our infrastructure? Where are the users abandoning
a checkout process? Why? Is the app having errors or performance issues in
that process?

I think it's ignored mostly because of what I said in the beginning - what it
means to be done. Ask teams questions around their app and users behavior and
a lot of the times the answers are wild guesses. Presenting insights at this
stage usually is a good 1st step, and once teams start adopting good devops
practices this becomes part of the journey and they realize the immense value
of telemetry. From what I've seen, it's the fastest way to adoption.

> That's very interesting. Is the AI part you're doing related with

> you're doing related with AI?

While we do [apply ML and AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-proactive-diagnostics)
on services like Application Insights, my journey into AI is not related to that.
On the team I belong, we were encouraged to lead initiatives out of our comfort
zone - so AI was the one that pushed me more out of my comfort zone and that's 
he one I took - assembling a small virtual team and leading that team into
discovering AI scenarios in unexplored territory.

Maybe it's my rock n roll background, but I love everything that has to do with
disruption and I believe AI will be responsible for the biggest society
disruption in history. Projects like [AI for good](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good)
are an inspiration and showcase the immense potential we have in our hands
right now to create a better world through the use of tech. Have you seen what
incredible people with disabilities are doing? Projects like the [Seeing AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVF2duPVUTY)
and the excellent [Hanselman demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5oTz1e5qqE)
on using tech for diabetes are just small examples of how the cloud, ML and AI
can be leveraged.

Also, I'm not that excellent with math, so becoming a Data Scientist is probably
not going to happen.  And from what I've seen, not every company has the required
knowledge to build custom AI apps. That's where pre-built services like
[Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/?v=18.05)
come in by allowing you add AI capabilities to an existing app with a single
REST call. I have a ton of fun with this and it's accessible to anyone.

Thank you for the invitation and your contribution for the community! As for
topics, I believe you are covering most of what I'd like to see (sometime ago
I was actually looking for this kind of info on 1:1's, recognition and a good
focus on the people side of tech and I couldn't find much. So please keep that
up! At some point, you could probably write a great step by step for new
engineering managers - like a 6 month plan template. I don't think there's
something like that out there.

As for a future interview, I'd recommend Marco Cecconi ([sklivvz](https://github.com/sklivvz)).
