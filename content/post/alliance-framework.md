Last week I finished reading [The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20763746-the-alliance).
I really liked the book and it helped me better understand my own views and
ideas on growing teams and developers. The book is small-ish and talks about
several processes that are used at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/). They
also have online materials and tools at [The Alliance
Framework](http://www.theallianceframework.com/) website.

When I was suggested to read this book I remember that I crused through the
reviews and I noticed that several bad reviews had a common theme: they said
that the ideas were good and interesting, but that they wouldn't be possible to
implement in a corporate company. That hinted that this book would bring out of
the box ideas and naturally I was very interested.

So what were my key take aways from the book? The concepts of **tours of duty**
and the **alliance** relationship.

# Tours of duty

I focus a lot on growing my team members. I have periodic [one on
ones](/post/1on1-framework/) with them, I may elaborate a long term [training
plan](/post/quarterly-training-plan/) for them. I set
[goals](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) and help them get there. But
something was missing. What's the big picture? For how _long_ should we pursuit
some objectives?

The **tour of duty** fills right in. The company (or the line manager?)
_suggest_ a tour of duty to the employee. Naturally we should understand the
desires and ambitions of the developers and suggest an appropriate tour of duty.
The tour of duty will have a time frame (2-5 years) and will help the developer
grow and give him experience that will be valuable in the market place. On the
other hand, the developers commits to finishing the duty and bringing back
value to the company.

If the employee wishes to _leave_ before finishing the tour of duty, he or she
will at least make sure that he prepares someone to replace him.

When the tour of duty finishes, we'll need to come up with another one. So for
employees, instead of focusing on _promotions_, they can focus on a set of tour
of duties that make them evolve and bring them closer to their own objectives.

# The alliance

The tour of duty works on top of the _alliance_ between the company and the
employee. We are allied with the company in achieving goals. This means that we,
the employees, will bring value to the company and that the company will provide
value back. It's like a contract the benefits both parties.

What if the company doesn't have a suitable tour of duty for an employee? What
if he or she grew so much that leaving the company is on the table. The alliance
framework expects that. The company will make the employees grow and get better
and _be_ more valuable. Naturally the company doesn't want to lose talent and
will work to make sure that it has valuable tours of duty to propose.

But if someone wants to leave, that's okay. Let's remain allies. The company sees
this as a tour of duty of the employee _elsewhere_ and actually focus a lot on
the alumni and getting people back.

If previously people were expected to work for a life time at a single company,
today we have people changing companies every couple of years. The alliance
framework works on top of this flow and tries to take the most out of it.

# Summary

This framework gave me lots of vocabulary for my own ideas. I do agree that the
alliance ideas are out of the box and unthinkable for some companies. But in times where
it's so hard to retain talent, maybe the best option is indeed to focus on
growing people while giving them reasons to stay.
