As a _line manager_ one of my responsibilities is to level up developers. This
is something very challenging that I started to like a lot. I have a primary
[goal](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) on my [1on1s](/post/1on1-framework/):
how can I level up this person?

This starts by trying to understand what my mentees value and where do they see
themselves. One way I try to do that is by asking: 

> Imagine that you are 10x more _better_. What does that look like?

<div style='clear:both'></div>
<!--more-->

It's very interesting that _usually_ I don't receive a straight answer. This is
something that we seem not to think about. We may have plans to get better, but
having a concrete vision of what that looks like is a different thing. If I ask
for other developers they look up to I'll have several references. But it seems
to me that even if we interact with top performers, we may not know what it
looks like for us to be much better. Our personality, tastes and experiences
will be different.

The next step will be to ask what makes a top performer more valuable. What
skills and practices do top performers have? And this is also hard. We may point
to some colleagues and pin point what makes them great, but not be able to have a
clear definition of a top performer.

And if we don't know our destination, it's harder to get there more efficiently.

# What makes a top performer?

From _my_ observations and experiences I started to register what _I_ consider to
be a list of skills and practices that top performers share. I try to have a
long term practical [training plan](/post/quarterly-training-plan/) to suggest.
But I also focus on day to day common tasks and how to improve them.

Most of
these things are debatable and depend on the environment, project and on people
themselves. But it does foster debate and acts as a starting point.

## Communication and Collaboration

We usually work in teams. Knowing how to communicate, [discuss our
ideas](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/), and collaborate is very
important.

### Communicate in writing

Writing is very important. It allow us to properly structure our
thoughts and leave context for the future. A top performer will take care in
everything that its registered in writing, so that other people can understand.

This means [RFCs](/post/rfc-driven-development/), [postmortems](/post/postmortem-culture/)
pull requests and commits, for example. There's always a set of reasons why we
need to write something. We should take time in properly explaining those _whys_
so that other people can understand our reasoning.

> Cavalheiro](/post/manager-interview-joao-cavalheiro/)

### Welcome feedback, have empathy and humility

When we share information we're exposing ourselves and our ideas. We will be
subject to criticism. That's actually to be expected and  to be well received. We
may have people that didn't understand our reasoning or maybe that don't agree
with it at all.

Knowing how to receive and give feedback, specially when the feedback is harsh, is hard.
We'll need to understand the point of view of our colleagues and accept it.
We'll need to understand that sometimes we're wrong and deal with it.

This process may be _slower_ and sometimes _frustrating_, but the outcome is
that our deliverables will be battle tested and overall with better quality.

### Flexible and pragmatic

Sometimes we need to compromise. We may have the best idea but it may not be
possible to accomplish it. We may need to take some _shortcuts_ to get there.
We work in groups of people and for companies. There are lots of ideas and
objectives on the table and we need to be _political_ in dealing with all that.

Everything has its tradeoffs and we need to be aware of them.

###  Continuous learning

We need to have a mindset of [continuous learning](/post/learning-index/). A
good strategy is to come up with learning sources and make the habit of using
them. I usually lean to books but I also know developers that find other ways
to stay up to date (podcasts,
meetups, conferences, peer networks, social media, ...). And this is
very important.

We need to do research and learn new things. Or else, how are we
going to know what's the best strategy to address new unseen problems?

### Continuous teaching and information sharing

Learning, feedback handling, being pragmatic, etc, are all useful tools a developer
may have. But to really potentiate this knowledge we need to be able to share
what we know and what we're doing with our team and company.

A good way to do this is when reviewing pull requests or RFCs. Trying not only
to analyse the text, but also trying to find improvement points our colleague may
have and present them in a healthy way.

## Behave like role models

[Leading by example](/post/most-effective-way-values-habits/) is a great way to
share best practices and to induce change. If we start changing our behaviours
to better alternatives other people will follow us.

### Put forth our expectations

We should share with our team and our line manager our expectations. Being clear
here can take away assumptions that may cause harm in the future. So we should
be clear in what we like and dislike.

We should also be clear about our strengths and weaknesses. If we're working
in an environment that fosters trust, this will be very important.

### Quality mindset

A top performer aims to deliver assets with good quality. This involves all
steps on delivering code. Trying to _really_ understand what's do be done, how
to test, and ensure that the deliverables are reliable and with few [bugs](/post/zero-bug-policy/),
and focusing on documenting when necessary.

By delivering with quality from the start, we can prevent that ping
pong that may occurs when we're verifying the deliverables.


###  knowledge

We should have the necessary knowledge to perform our tasks. We should know
about the business domain overall and aim to understand how all parts interact.

In technical terms, we should know the project ecosystem. This means _where_
things are done, or how to find out where they are done. How to handle
dependencies and how to troubleshoot them. How to deploy how is the production
environments (and the others) configured.

It's also helpful to understand a bit about the work of our peers from other
roles. For example, if we're working on the backend, we should know a bit about
the frontend, QA processes, DevOps and infrastructure,
etc.

### Be humble

How do we know that we don't have the best idea if we don't welcome feedback?
We need to accept all inputs and see the value in them. If we are closed to
outside considerations we'll have poorer outcomes. Even if we in fact have the
best strategy and are more experienced than our teammates, just having the
process to reason and explain the whys will make our proposition better.

### Mentoring

Sharing what we know and _growing_ our teammates is the best thing we can do to
grow ourselves. When we share knowledge and best practices, we turn those around
us into better developers. And, in turn, we'll become better developers because
we're working with top performers.

> (...) you help people grow through mentoring, because mentoring = I was there, I can
> share with you how I did it, what I learned and what I believe can help you
> (...) - [Interview with Monika
> Wojtasinska-Felicio](/post/coach-interview-monika-wojtasinska-felicio/)

We should see ourselves as _mentors_ every time we have a teammate that is less
experienced or proficient in something that we're comfortable with. Sometimes I
have something to do and I have a less experienced developer teaming up with
me. When that happens, I usually ask my teammate to lead. To act as the _tech
lead_ and _commmand_ me. And naturally I'll be there to help on every step of our
path.

## Technical proficiency

I've mentioning mostly _soft_ and _social_ skills. But naturally our processes
while we perform our craft are also very important.

### Code deliverables

We should write code that is easy to change, that uses proper abstractions, that
is easy to understand and copy paste friendly.

But what does that mean? How do we know we're getting there? This comes with
experience. Even top performers will struggle with making code that is easy to
understand and change. This is why peer review is very important. Because
sometimes we _think_ it's okay, but our teammates may not agree. And then we
iterate until we reach a better version of our deliverables.

The most important thing is to _decide_ that we want to write _good code_.
Sometimes we just have some habits, and they seem to work. But we may be using
[patterns that are a recipe for trouble](/post/code-patterns-that-are-a-recipe-for-trouble/).
We need to constantly question our beliefs.

### Know several programming languages

I see a lot of people that focus on just _one_ programming language and are
advocates for it. But [knowing several languages and ecosystems has lots of
advantages](/post/from-rails-to-clojure-to-java-to-rails/).

We learn about different ways of doing things and this will shape our day to day
coding processes. Different languages may have different strategies and ways to
represent how we model problems. Knowing about those strategies broadens up our
perspectives.

For example, take the [Rust Programming
Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). By studying it I learned about
ownership and borrowing, that are approaches for managing mutable state that I
never had seen before. I don't know if this concept will be useful for me in
the future or not, but I really feel there's value there and I'm happy to have
learned about it.

### Use functional programming concepts

Learning functional programming languages totally changed the way I code. I
remember a time where I was not happy with what I was delivering. Even if I took
special care, I'd have bugs and issues to solve. Code would be hard to change
and adapt. I started to wonder: is there a different and better way of doing
this?

Learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) taught me so many things that I use
whenever I code, even if I'm not using a functional programming language
anymore: pure functions, immutability, function composition, no side effects,
modeling data with `map`/`reduce`/`filter`.

There we have these mechanisms that prevent whole classes of bugs for appearing
on our code.

### Testing

I find it strange that today we sometimes need to debate the _value_ of tests.
Honestly I wouldn't know how to program without tests. Whenever I need to do
something, I start with the tests. This is a habit and, again, we need to decide
it's something we _want_ to do. And then iterate on being better at it.

When we're comfortable with unit testing, we can start to consider other tools,
like end to end testing, contract based testing, [mutation testing](/post/mutation-testing/) and generative testing.

> Mutation testing is the process of heuristically determining semantics of your
> program that are not covered by tests. - [Interview with Markus Schirp](/post/consultant-interview-markus-schirp/)

We may not have the need for all this, but knowing how they work and how these
techniques can add value is very important.

When I suggest a change I may have the I don't have time excuse. That can mean:

* I don't think that the change brings value enough for me to invest time in it
* I believe the change is good, but it will compromise my productivity
