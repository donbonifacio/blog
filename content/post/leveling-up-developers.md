As a _line manager_ one of my responsibilities is to level up developers. This
is something very challenging that I started to like a lot. I have a primary
[goal](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) on my [1on1s](/post/1on1-framework/):
how can I level up this person? How can I follow the work that is being done and give
good, candid, actionable feedback? How can _we_ know that in fact we're
improving?

This starts by trying to understand what my mentees value and where do they see
themselves. I try to do that is by asking:

> Imagine that you are 10x more _better_. What does that look like?

<div style='clear:both'></div>
<!--more-->

It's very interesting that _usually_ I don't receive a straight answer. This is
something that we seem not to think about. We may have plans to get better, but
having a concrete vision of what that looks like is a different thing. If I ask
for other developers they look up to I'll have several references. But it seems
to me that even if we interact with top performers, we may not know what it
looks like for us to be much better. Our personality, _tastes_ and experiences
will be different.

The next step will be to ask what makes a top performer more valuable. What
skills and practices do top performers have? And this is also hard. We may point
to some colleagues and pin point what makes them great, but not be able to have a
clear definition of a top performer.

And if we don't know our destination, it's harder to get there more efficiently.

# How to grow top performers?

There are _tons_ of improvement points we can spot on a developer, if we take
the time to pay attention. With so many things to improve, how can we tackle it?
A good approach I've seen is what _sport coaches_ do. We may doing some movement
badly, they see us and note about 100 things to improve. But will say: _Okay,
you're doing good. Now try to focus on this specific thing_. The next day, we're
better at that thing and they'll say: _Awesome progress. Now try to focus on
that other thing_. And step by step we get improvements. We always have a
positive feedback loop. But sometimes they will also show us the hard reality and
say: _That performance could be much better. We'll need to work on it_.

First we need to understand and _decide_ that we want to be better. Then we need
to change our day to day processes towards that goal. We are what we repeatedly
do. But there's sometimes inertia or beliefs that constrain us. I may suggest
some change and get a _"I don't have time for that"_ excuse. Usually this means:

1. I don't think that the change brings enough value for me to invest time in it
1. I believe the change is good, but it will compromise my productivity

Regarding 1), usually I didn't sell my suggestion well. Sometimes I may
actually be presenting solutions to problems they never had. Or I may even need
to [question my own
beliefs](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/) and consider if the change is really good.

Option 2) is more common. To _change_ we need to invest. We leave our [comfort
zone](/post/comfort-zone-index/) when we're
[learning](/post/learning-index/) new things and naturally that will affect our
[productivity](/post/productivity-index/). But that's part of the process. We
invest time, we _change_, and we get improvements.

This is also an investment on my part. If I _commit_ to focus on improving
developers, I'll need to invest time in following what they are doing. This is
not easy and takes time. So I also expect commitment in return. The next section
will be about all the little things I try to pay attention and will bring to the
table for discussion.

## Give me your opinion

This post is the result of my observations. Naturally it's biased and based on
my point of views and the experiences I've had. In my own quest for improvement,
I'm applying the scientific method here. This is my hypothesis, and now I'm
taking it to be tested with my readers. Then I'll gather that data and use
it to improve my process.

So I'll ask you to share your opinions with me (contacts on the bottom of the
page). How can I improve my process? What are those things that I value that you
don't believe are that important? What else am I missing?

# What makes a top performer?

From _my_ experiences I started to register what _I_ consider to
be a list of skills and practices that top performers share. I try to have a
long term practical [training plan](/post/quarterly-training-plan/) to suggest.
But I also focus on day to day common tasks and how to improve them.

Most of
these things are debatable and depend on the environment, project and on people
themselves. But it does foster debate and acts as a starting point.

## Communication and Collaboration

We usually work in teams. Knowing how to communicate, discuss our
ideas, and collaborate is very
important.

### Communicate in writing

Writing is very important. It allow us to properly structure our
thoughts and leave context for the future. A top performer will take care in
everything that its registered in writing, so that other people can understand.

This means [RFCs](/post/rfc-driven-development/), [postmortems](/post/postmortem-culture/)
pull requests and commits, for example. There's always a set of reasons why we
need to write something. We should take time in properly explaining those _whys_
so that other people can understand our reasoning.

> My mantra for remote teams is: "What is not written does not exist". -
> [Interview with JoÃ£o
> Cavalheiro](/post/manager-interview-joao-cavalheiro/)

### Welcome feedback, have empathy and humility

When we share information we're exposing ourselves and our ideas. We will be
subject to criticism. That's actually to be expected and  to be well received. We
may have people that didn't understand our reasoning or maybe that don't agree
with it at all.

Knowing how to receive and give feedback, specially when the feedback is harsh, is hard.
We'll need to understand the point of view of our colleagues and accept it.
We'll need to understand that [sometimes we're wrong and deal with
it](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/).

This process may be _slower_ and sometimes _frustrating_, but the outcome is
that our deliverables will be battle tested and overall with better quality.

### Flexible and pragmatic

Sometimes we need to compromise. We may have the best idea but it may not be
possible to accomplish it. We may need to take some _shortcuts_ to get there.
We work in groups of people and for companies. There are lots of ideas and
objectives on the table and we need to be _political_ in dealing with all that.

Everything has its tradeoffs and we need to be aware of them.

###  Continuous learning

We need to have a mindset of [continuous learning](/post/learning-index/). A
good strategy is to come up with learning sources and make the habit of using
them. I usually lean to books but I also know developers that find other ways
to stay up to date (podcasts,
meetups, conferences, peer networks, social media, ...). And this is
very important.

We need to do research and learn new things. Or else, how are we
going to know what's the best strategy to address new unseen problems?

### Continuous teaching and information sharing

Learning, feedback handling, being pragmatic, etc, are all useful tools a developer
may have. But to really potentiate this knowledge we need to be able to share
what we know and what we're doing with our team and company.

A good way to do this is when reviewing pull requests or RFCs. Trying not only
to focus on verifying quality, but also trying to find improvement points
our colleague may have and present them in a healthy way.

## Behave like role models

[Leading by example](/post/most-effective-way-values-habits/) is a great way to
share best practices and to induce change. If we start changing our behaviours
to better alternatives other people will follow us.

### Quality mindset

A top performer aims to deliver assets with good quality. This involves all
steps on delivering code. Trying to _really_ understand what's to be done, how
to test, and ensure that the deliverables are reliable and with [few bugs](/post/zero-bug-policy/),
and focusing on documenting when necessary.

By delivering with quality from the start, we can prevent that ping
pong that may occurs when we're verifying the deliverables.


###  Knowledge

We should have the necessary knowledge to perform our tasks. We should know
about the business domain overall and aim to understand how all parts interact.

In technical terms, we should know the project ecosystem. This means _where_
things are done, or how to find out where they are done. How to handle
dependencies and how to troubleshoot them. How to deploy and how is the production
environment (and the others) configured.

It's also helpful to understand a bit about the work of our peers from other
roles. For example, if we're working on the backend, we should know a bit about
the frontend, QA processes, DevOps and infrastructure,
etc.

### Be humble

How do we know that we don't have the best idea if we don't welcome feedback?
We need to accept all inputs and see the value in them. If we are closed to
outside considerations we'll have poorer outcomes. Even if we in fact have the
best strategy and are more experienced than our teammates, just having the
process to reason and explain the whys will make our proposition better.

> Just because we're the best in the neighbourhood doesn't mean we're good.

### Mentoring

Sharing what we know and _growing_ our teammates is the best thing we can do to
grow ourselves. When we share knowledge and best practices, we turn those around
us into better developers. And, in turn, we'll become better developers because
we're working with top performers.

> (...) you help people grow through mentoring, because mentoring = I was there, I can
> share with you how I did it, what I learned and what I believe can help you
> (...) - [Interview with Monika
> Wojtasinska-Felicio](/post/coach-interview-monika-wojtasinska-felicio/)

We should see ourselves as _mentors_ every time we have a teammate that is less
experienced or proficient in something that we're comfortable with. Sometimes I
have something to do and I have a less experienced developer teaming up with
me. When that happens, I usually ask my teammate to lead. To act as the _tech
lead_ and _commmand_ me. And naturally I'll be there to help on every step of
the way.

## Technical proficiency

I've mentioning mostly _soft_ and _social_ skills. But naturally our processes
while we perform our craft are also very important.

### Code deliverables

We should write code that is easy to change, that uses proper abstractions, that
is easy to understand and copy paste friendly.

But what does that mean? How do we know we're getting there? This comes with
experience. Even top performers will struggle with making code that is easy to
understand and change. This is why peer review is very important. Because
sometimes we _think_ it's okay, but our teammates may not agree. And then we
iterate until we reach a better version of our deliverables.

The most important thing is to _decide_ that we want to write _good code_.
Sometimes we just have some habits, and they seem to work. But we may be using
[patterns that are a recipe for trouble](/post/code-patterns-that-are-a-recipe-for-trouble/).
We need to constantly question our beliefs.

### Know several programming languages

I see a lot of people that focus on just _one_ programming language and are
advocates for it. But [knowing several languages and ecosystems has lots of
advantages](/post/from-rails-to-clojure-to-java-to-rails/).

We learn about different ways of doing things and this will shape our day to day
coding processes. Different languages may have different strategies and ways to
represent how we model problems. Knowing about those strategies broadens up our
perspectives.

For example, take the [Rust Programming
Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). By studying it I learned about
ownership and borrowing, that are approaches for managing mutable state that I
never had seen before. I don't know if this concept will be useful for me in
the future or not, but I really feel there's value there and I'm happy to have
learned about it.

### Use functional programming concepts

Learning functional programming languages totally changed the way I code. I
remember a time where I was not happy with what I was delivering. Even if I took
special care, I'd have bugs and issues to solve. Code would be hard to change
and adapt. I started to wonder: is there a different and better way of doing
this?

Learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) taught me so many things that I use
whenever I code, even if I'm not using a functional programming language
anymore: pure functions, immutability, function composition, no side effects,
modeling data with `map`/`reduce`/`filter`.

There we have these mechanisms that prevent whole classes of bugs for appearing
on our code.

### Testing

I find it strange that today we sometimes need to debate the _value_ of tests.
Honestly I wouldn't know how to program without tests. Whenever I need to do
something, I start with the tests. This is a habit and, again, we need to decide
it's something we _want_ to do. And then iterate on being better at it.

When we're comfortable with unit testing, we can start to consider other tools,
like end to end testing, contract based testing, [mutation testing](/post/mutation-testing/) and generative testing.

> Mutation testing is the process of heuristically determining semantics of your
> program that are not covered by tests. - [Interview with Markus Schirp](/post/consultant-interview-markus-schirp/)

We may not have the need for all these, but knowing how they work and how these
techniques can add value is very important.

> "I canât recall ever getting a call to help a department or program get its
> application back on the rails and discovering a nice, healthy unit test
> suite." - [Interview with Erik
> Dietrich](/post/consultant-interview-erik-dietrich/)

### DevOps mindset

We should not focus just on our code and its delivery, but also on how
that's going to be used, how it's going to be supported and how it connects with
the current infrastructure. We may do something that causes problems elsewhere:
on the build pipelines, on other services, performance issues and even putting
production _down_.

Monitoring and the ability to inspect what we're doing is very important. And
when things go wrong, let's not forget a [postmortem](/post/postmortem-culture/).

### Debug and troubleshooting

Top performers are usually great at
[troubleshooting](/post/bug-that-was-not-our-mistake-except-it-was/). They properly understand
what they did and how that relates with other moving parts. They can triage and
go from the overall problem to the specific issue that caused it. This means
knowledge not only of the code, but also having a tool belt of skills and tools
for when problems occur. This is specially useful when we're dealing with code
and infrastructure that _we don't own_.

One way to improve this skill is to have a [production incident training program](/post/production-incident-training-program/).

### Tooling

We use several tools every day. From our code editor to bash commands. We should
take time to understand and customize those tools. For example, I'm a `vim`
user. I don't get in _editor wars_, but I do try to optimize it to my needs.
I've seen developers with several types of editors that are able to take the
most out of them. Know and customize your editor.

Another example is `git`. It's useful knowing not only the basic operations, but
also how to revert actions, how to rewrite history with interactive rebasing, and
how to build a good commit _timeline_.

And finally, we have the process to understand how things are done by looking at
the manual and/or the source code. It's said that we can save _minutes_ of reading
documentation if we invest _hours_ of trial and error.

## Vision

A _good_ attitude is the most remarkable trait of a top performer. When I'm
doing interviews I like to ask: _"Imagine that you are now the boss of your
project, that you have the power to do anything, what would you do?"_.

Typically I get some standard responses: following the roadmap, continue to
deliver features, business as usual.

But top performers will have a ton of things to say. They'll want to improve
this and that, they would refactor a system, they would focus on making tools
for the team to be better, on changing and improving processes, etc.
Note that it's important to _check_ if they
would commit to doing those things. There's where the value is at. Having ideas for
other people to implement, without experience on that regard, is not what I'm
looking for.

# Success stories

I'd like to share some stories of developers that I interacted with that have the
top performer mindset. What were their attitude and how they grew. Let's call
them David, Olivia and Thomas.

## David

This is a very _cocky_ guy that worked with me. We booted a project and I
remember that on our first day he told me that he would be better and more
productive than me. We had never worked together but we knew each other from the
office.

Whenever I created a pull request, it was as his life mission was to find
problems with my code. He'd question everything, and even discuss when something
was not easy to understand. If he actually agreed with something, we'd play the
devils advocate. He was on a deep learning quest and wanted to extract the most
out of me. I do recognize that sometimes this was frustrating. _Always_ being
questioned is not something easy to handle.

But the truth is that we _both_ grew a lot in the process. We later went
different ways. He applied to a company that only hires experienced developers
(10+ years) and he was still _junior_ (3+ years). Not only did he join them, but
a year later they offered him a role with even more responsibilities.

It was his drive to become better that allowed his career to sky rocket.

## Olivia

Once I was doing recruiting consulting. I would get candidates and would do
triage and give back a _report_. At this one time I got someone that became
memorable. She was also _cocky_ and had 3 years of experience doing an
application single handed. She did backend, frontend, operations, etc. Was very
versatile and with a get things done attitude. I liked her a lot. I asked her to
assess the quality level of her code and she said it was great.

Confident, resourceful, and also eager to learn. Time to check her
personality. I told her: _I'm going to report back that you are a junior
developer_. She looked puzzled. I noted that she was struggling to choose what to
say next. After some time she said something amazing: _why do you think that?_.
She didn't strike back, she didn't try to defend herself. She only wanted to know
my reasoning.

And I told her that working alone doesn't provide as much skills. She isn't doing
much testing, she isn't doing code that is easy to change and peer reviewed. She
lacked experience in pull request etiquette. I also asked her to consider this
scenario: she would imagine another version of herself, but who had worked 3
years with 10 other developers, all of them top performers. And she replied back:
_okay I understand now, I still have a lot to learn_.

This was already amazing. But what happened the next 5 days was even better.
Every day she would go to the chat and ask me things:

* How did you get to be where you are?
* What's the most important thing you've learned?
* What books do you suggest for me to read?

She was trying to learn as much as possible to make herself better.

## Thomas

I had started working on a project that had [many quality
issues](/post/project-no-one-wants-to-work-at/). There was this guy that worked
there and followed the stream but was not okay with that. This is very
interesting. Even if we care about quality, we may relax it if we're in an
environment that is not quality friendly. Quality is like a muscle, we need to
train it constantly.

When I stepped in I came with all my ideas and suggestions and little by little
we started to change the quality of our deliverables. And Thomas would question
my suggestions and sometimes say they were cumbersome.

This is very typical. I remember when I [started working in
Java](/post/from-rails-to-clojure-to-java-to-rails/) and I didn't know Java at
all, that I created a test project and setup a linter/code analyser check on the
build. And that thing was nagging me _all_ the time. But one month later it
stopped. I actually assumed that it had stopped working, but when I went to
_fix_ it, I realised that it was in fact still working, but it was _me_ that had
changed by code writing practice to accommodate the linter.

In this project we had this experience many times: starting to write good commit
messages, start to delivering patches with good code coverage, all bug pull
requests need a test that covers the issue, code should be clean and easy to
understand and change, we should document the _whys_ when necessary, we should
have a build system that double checks everything we can, etc, etc.

Thomas adapted and little by little he transformed. His pull requests are now a
_work of art_. And he grew and he is now pushing me to be better.


# Summary

You may have noticed that not once I mentioned proficiency. Usually top
performers are very skillful. But when talking about growing I'm more focused on
the journey than on the final destination. It's by practicing every day, by
focusing on having better processes that we evolve into better developers.

This is an ongoing process for me also. Many times I struggle and fail at
growing developers. So don't forget to give me feedback
to help me get better.

Another thing to consider: what is the end game? If a developer achieves all
these processes and even more, is that the end game? No. I'd say that is just
the beginning. When we reach a higher level of performance the important thing
is how to scale it. So if someone is a top performer, the next step will be: how
can I mentor other developers to be _better_ than me?

And when we reach that point? Well, this compounds: how can I train someone that will
train other people to be even better at growing top developers?
