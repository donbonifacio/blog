As a _line manager_ one of my responsibilities is to level up developers. This
is something very challenging that I started to like a lot. I have a primary
[goal](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) on my [1on1s](/post/1on1-framework/):
how can I level up this person?

This starts by trying to understand what my mentees value and where do they see
themselves. One way I try to do that is by asking: 

> Imagine that you are 10x more _better_. What does that look like?

<div style='clear:both'></div>
<!--more-->

It's very interesting that _usually_ I don't receive a straight answer. This is
something that we seem not to think about. We may have plans to get better, but
having a concrete vision of what that looks like is a different thing. If I ask
for other developers they look up to I'll have several references. But it seems
to me that even if we interact with top performers, we may not know what it
looks like for us to be much better. Our personality, tastes and experiences
will be different.

The next step will be to ask what makes a top performer more valuable. What
skills and practices do top performers have? And this is also hard. We may point
to some colleagues and pin point what makes them great, but not be able to have a
clear definition of a top performer.

And if we don't know our destination, it's harder to get there more efficiently.

# What makes a top performer?

From _my_ observations and experiences I started to register what _I_ consider to
be a list of skills and practices that top performers share. I try to have a
long term practical [training plan](/post/quarterly-training-plan/) to suggest.
But I also focus on day to day common tasks and how to improve them.

Most of
these things are debatable and depend on the environment, project and on people
themselves. But it does foster debate and acts as a starting point.

## Communication and Collaboration

We usually work in teams. Knowing how to communicate, [discuss our
ideas](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/), and collaborate is very
important.

### Communicate in writing

Writing is very important. It allow us to properly structure our
thoughts and leave context for the future. A top performer will take care in
everything that its registered in writing, so that other people can understand.

This means [RFCs](/post/rfc-driven-development/), [postmortems](/post/postmortem-culture/)
pull requests and commits, for example. There's always a set of reasons why we
need to write something. We should take time in properly explaining those _whys_
so that other people can understand our reasoning.

### Welcome feedback, have empathy and humility

When we share information we're exposing ourselves and our ideas. We will be
subject to criticism. That's actually to be expected and  to be well received. We
may have people that didn't understand our reasoning or maybe that don't agree
with it at all.

Knowing how to receive and give feedback, specially when the feedback is harsh, is hard.
We'll need to understand the point of view of our colleagues and accept it.
We'll need to understand that sometimes we're wrong and deal with it.

This process may be _slower_ and sometimes _frustrating_, but the outcome is
that our deliverables will be battle tested and overall with better quality.

### Flexible and pragmatic

Sometimes we need to compromise. We may have the best idea but it may not be
possible to accomplish it. We may need to take some _shortcuts_ to get there.
We work in groups of people and for companies. There are lots of ideas and
objectives on the table and we need to be _political_ in dealing with all that.

Everything has its tradeoffs and we need to be aware of them.

###  Continuous learning

We need to have a mindset of [continuous learning](/post/learning-index/). A
good strategy is to come up with learning sources and make the habit of using
them. I usually lean to books but I also know developers that find other ways
to stay up to date (podcasts,
meetups, conferences, peer networks, social media, ...). And this is
very important.

We need to do research and learn new things. Or else, how are we
going to know what's the best strategy to address new unseen problems?

### Continuous teaching and information sharing

Learning, feedback handling, being pragmatic, etc, are all useful tools a developer
may have. But to really potentiate this knowledge we need to be able to share
what we know and what we're doing with our team and company.

A good way to do this is when reviewing pull requests or RFCs. Trying not only
to analyse the text, but also trying to find improvement points our colleague may
have and present them in a healthy way.

## Behave like role models

[Leading by example](/post/most-effective-way-values-habits/) is a great way to
share best practices and to induce change. If we start changing our behaviours
to better alternatives other people will follow us.

### Put forth our expectations

We should share with our team and our line manager our expectations. Being clear
here can take away assumptions that may cause harm in the future. So we should
be clear in what we like and dislike.

We should also be clear about our strengths and weaknesses. If we're working
in an environment that fosters trust, this will be very important.

### Quality mindset

Quality and value mindset

Have good knowledge  - Know the business domains and project ecosystem

### Be humble

How do we know that we don't have the best idea if we don't welcome feedback?
We need to accept all inputs and see the value in them. If we are closed to
outside considerations we'll have poorer outcomes. Even if we in fact have the
best strategy and are more experienced than our teammates, just having the
process to reason and explain the whys will make our proposition better.

> Just because we're the best in the neighbourhood doesn't mean we're good

Mentoring

## Technical proficiency
Know about some languages, each tool for the job. But hightly skill in one is
also ok. Rust
Code that is easy to change, that use proper abstractions, that is easy to
understand and copy paste friendly
Functional programming concepts
Tests (mutatin, generative, end to end)

## Non direct responsibilities
Interested Have know how of DevOps/operations/deploys/CI
Debug and troubleshooting
- Knows their tooling
- View readme/docs/source code
- Knows about version control, how to rebase interactive, how to build a story
Have a vision

# How to grow top performers?

This is a lot. So how do we train people on this? Step by step
- metaphor of the fitness coach that trains little by little

Points not about skillset, but about day to day practice
You are what you repeatedly do. Use this to your advantage by doing the things you want to become.
When I suggest a change I may have the I don't have time excuse. That can mean:

* I don't think that the change brings value enough for me to invest time in it
* I believe the change is good, but it will compromise my productivity

# Give me your opinion

Scientific method: these are my hypothesis, you are my peers
Survey for feedback
