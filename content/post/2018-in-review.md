I _created_ this blog almost one year ago. It has been quite a ride. I have
shared a lot and I have learned a lot also. I've published [50 articles](/post/),
divided in 30 opinion articles, [13 interviews](/categories/interviews/) and the rest
are references to videos.

During this year I've had +20k unique visitors. My top 5 most visited articles
are:

1. [From Rails to Clojure, then to Java, then back to Rails](/post/from-rails-to-clojure-to-java-to-rails/)
1. [Code patterns that are a recipe for trouble](/post/code-patterns-that-are-a-recipe-for-trouble/)
1. [My framework for one-on-ones](/post/1on1-framework/)
1. [That project where no one wants to work at](/post/project-no-one-wants-to-work-at/)
1. [Create an onboarding template](/post/onboarding-template/)

The most visited articles are clearly the ones where the links were upvoted on
reddit and hackernews, thus reaching more people.

But at the end of the day, I may have tons of visitors, but that ends up being
just a vanity metric. I actually get much more value from my shares on Linkedin
and Twitter. Over there I get feedback and questions from my network that lead
to valuable information exchange.

I learned _a lot_ from the [interviews](/categories/interviews/) I've done. I do
want to continue doing them, but it does require an investment on my part and
sometimes it's hard to motivate my interviewees not to keep the interview for
ever. Maybe I need to revisit the concept somehow.

My publishing strategy has been the following: one interview on Mondays, one
article on Wednesday, and sharing old posts on Friday. Sometimes It's hard to
keep this going, because work and life happens. Sometimes I don't have
_anything_ to write about or I'm not motivated and take some weeks off. But
honestly I'm being able to publish more articles than I had anticipated.

## Work

This has been a year filled with new challenges. On the beginning of the year I
took the challenge of bootstraping a development team from scratch. Usually I'd
be on a team and would have to onboard new people. This has its challenges but
it's _easier_ when we already have flows and processes working.

With a new team we have lots of experiences and ways of working and we're
trying to find out what is our identity and the best way to work together. This
was very challenging. Even with the concern to hire people that shared the same
[values](/post/most-effective-way-values-habits/), we sometimes struggled to _align_ on processes and how to work.

But if one hand we did have an investment in aligning people, I do believe that
the end result was worth it. We had to learn how to compromise, [test our beliefs](/post/how-to-convince-others-that-we-are-right/)
and reach a middle ground. But getting several opinions and different ways to
work on the table, allowed us to take the best our of it. We're still learning
to take the best out of it, and we still have a long way to go, but
this process has been very interesting.

I was also reminded that [goals](/post/importance-of-setting-goals/) and
[deadlines](/post/dealing-with-deadlines/) are great for having focus and
alignment.

## Books

I've read [15 books this
year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10901273). I'd say that this is
my preferred way of [learning new things](/post/learning-index/). There were a
couple of books that really resonated with me and changed my day to day
behaviour.

I do think that it's not enough. For the net year I'll aim to read 20 books.
This will enforce me to change my habits, so lets see how that works out.

## Summary

I really like to write for the blog. It forces me to structure my thoughts and
allows for great feedback. Without a doubt this is accomplishing my goals
with the blog: learning new things, sharing my ideas and train my written
communication.

So here are some goals for 2019:

* Publish 50 opinion articles
* Publish 10 interviews
* Try to get some guest posts?
* Review the newsletter format
