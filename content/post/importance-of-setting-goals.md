![Importance of setting goals](/img/setting-goals.png)

Having goals is very important to make sure we're [productive](/post/productivity-index/)
and delivering value.

<!--more-->

# How to know how much value we're adding?

Having goals means that we can focus and see the road ahead. A nice test
we can do the assess the healthiness of our goals is to ask on [one-on-ones](/post/1on1-framework/)
the following:

> What are your goals for the next quarter?

We can have several types of responses:

* I guess I'll just follow the backlog and do what's assigned to me
* I can't commit to goals because I don't know what's going to be done
* I'll do the same I've been doing

This is the most common I've seen so far. We don't know where we're headed
so we just follow the stream. Another question that might bring up this problem
is:

> Can you sum up what you've done on the previous 6 months? And your team?

This may be very frustrating. I've been on the other side of this question
thinking that I felt that I've done a lot and accomplished a lot, but not
being able to properly communicate that.

All this is a huge problem. Because if we can't clearly articulate the value
we've added so far, or the value we're going to add, how will our stakeholders
do so? That will create trust issues and will affect [recognition](/post/recognition-index/).
We may have the leadership starting to push [deadlines](/post/dealing-with-deadlines/)
because they may think the team is slacking.

# It starts at the top

For we to feel aligned with the company and have a sense of purpose we need
to know what are the main company goals. And then we can have team goals and
personal goals. If all these are aligned we know that we're going in the
same direction.

But gathering these goals can be very complicated. It may be very hard to have
a vision of what's to come and translate that into meaningful goals. Fortunately
this is something that can be trained. We just need to exercise it and [learn](/post/learning-index/)
as we go along. We need to get better in clarifying things that are in the
future and that we don't know much about.

But my main point here: if we, as managers or leaders, don't know the value
that is being added or that was added, then _we_ need to make something about
it.

# Goals should be attainable

We should have ambitious goals, but they should be attainable. We should be
able to see where we're heading and understand what's the end game. I'm currently
struggling with two types of goals and I'd like to break them down here.

## Goal example 1: To be a market leader

So image that the company's leadership get together and comes up with this goal:
_we want to be market leaders_. This is actually a typical example on OKRs (objectives
and key results framework).

But when I look at this, I don't see it as being attainable. I start having
several questions:

* What's a market leader?
* Who's the current market leader?
* How will we know that we're the market leader?
* What happens when we reach market leader? What's next?

This seems very vague to me. We could fine tune the goal. For example: _we want
to be market leaders on a specific niche_. This
is more focused but still raises several questions. Here's another one:

* Should we aim for few big clients, or for may small clients?

Okay, maybe that question is not so much about goals but about direction. Even
so it's very important. Because if we're not aligned and the development squad
is doing features for small clients but marketing is communicating for big clients,
then we have a problem.

The great thing about this is that discussing these topics allows us to better
understand where we're going. It's not so much about knowing the answers, but
following the path to be continuously iterating.

In the OKRs way, we may have objectives but we also need quantifiable _key
results_. This means that we set an objective and the key results will tell
us if we're getting there. Again, it may also be very difficult to elaborate them.
But if we can't come up with proper goals and key results how are we going
to succeed?

## Goal example 2: What's the 10x better version of you?

A question I asked on a [one-on-one](/post/1on1-framework/) was the following:

> Imagine that in 2 years you are 10 times better than today. What does that
> mean, and how to get there?

My mentee took it as homework and on the next session I got an answer:

* I'll need to know more about the business rules
* I'll need to improve more in technical terms
* I need to be better organised

This was very interesting and a source of a great discussion. If we try to apply
the OKRs principles here we can see that the goals aren't attainable. They
are very vague. We can't see the end game here. I asked for a vision of what
means to be better, and I got a plan to get better. But how can we plan for
something that is vague?

Imagine that we're building an invoicing software. Let's deconstruct the _I'll
need to know more about the business rules_. To see the end game we should
be able to set a more specific (and ambitious) goal. For example: _I want
to be proficient in the Portuguese invoicing rules, so that I don't need
to consult an account when customers pose questions._

Okay, now we have something more concrete. We can clearly see what reaching
that goal looks like. How do we know that we're getting there?

* We can do an accounting training course (?)
* We'll take 5 hard questions and try to answer them by ourselves, like going
  to the law books and doing research, and then asking the accountant for
  a review
* We can measure how many account related questions we don't know how to
  answer and decrease that by 20%
* We'll review section X of the site aiming to understand all rules going on

Does this look like a better plan? Forcing us to define proper _key results_
is hard but really tests our vision.

# Time bound goals

It's very important to have a time frame on our goals. The time frame forces us
to better define the scope and understand what's to come. As an example, consider
the _I'll add automatic payments to our app_ goal. If we put a time frame on this,
let's say a quarter, we are forced to limit scope to accomplish that goal. We
may realise that we can implement paypal but we can't do stripe just now. So
we may change the goal to _I'll add paypal support to our app_. Which would be
the end result anyway. But by creating the deadline we force ourselves to assess
the time investment we'll need. And if we have enough of it.

I'd say that a goal without a deadline can turn out to be just whishful thinking.

# Summary

Defining goals at the company level, at the team level and at individual level,
that are all aligned, that are attainable and with key results that are properly
measurable is very hard.

But trying to achieve it will be great for a better understanding of where we're
going and how to get there together. Without these goals we may have teams that
are going in different directions and aren't aware of it. We won't be able to
see what we've done and what we need to do _today_ to accomplish something
tomorrow.

Like the saying says: "if we don't know where we are going, then all
directions are okay".
