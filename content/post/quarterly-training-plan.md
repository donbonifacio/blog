Having a [continuous learning mindset](/post/learning-index/) is very important.
To reap the most benefits we should make a plan and have goals on what to
learn.

# Time bound goals

Wanting to learn new things or accomplish something without a [deadline](/post/dealing-with-deadlines/)
may end up being wishful thinking. If we set a date and a goal we have better
changes of achieving it. Imagine that we want to learn Japanese. It's important
to time bound that goal. If we instead say that we want to learn Japanese
in one year we start to have a clear picture of what we'll need to invest
in terms of our routine.

Another thing to consider is the level we'll aiming at. So a better learning
goal would be: be able to watch a movie in Japanese without subtitles and
understand most of it, in a year.

# Be aware of business as usual

When we start in a new company or project we may be learning a lot. We may be
learning new technologies but we'll surely be learning the project business
rules, the current structure, the decisions taken, etc. But this learning will be decreasing over time.
So, in 6 months we may not be learning that much, and instead we'll be at
a peack of [performance and productivity](/post/productivity-index/).

So what to do then? We may have some tasks that push for learning, and we'll
be lucky if that's the case. If that's not the case, then we should invest
in having other means of learning.

# The quarterly training plan

In my [one-on-ones](/post/1on1-framework/) I try to come up with training goals
for each quarter. Usually we have some long term objective to aim for. I try
to ask my mentee to come up with the training plan based on his interests and
also on added value to the project and to the company.

But from my experience it's very hard for us to delineate a training plan and
implement it. Specially more _junior_ people may struggle, because they don't
have much experience on the problems they'll face.

It's always hard to search for answers for problems that we don't have
experienced yet.

Focusing on a quarter allow us to have some time to implement the plan and
be able to fine tune it over the year.

## Plan templates

If it's hard to create a custom plan for someone, we can start with a predefined
template. I find this very useful for newcomers. For example, imagine the following
training plan for a Java backend developer.

### Quarter 1

* Attend an online course on fundamentals of: git, SQL, bash and other tooling
  we may use
* Read a technical book on Java ([Effective Java Programming Language Guide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105099.Effective_Java_Programming_Language_Guide?ac=1&from_search=true))
* Read a soft skills book ([The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team?ac=1&from_search=true))

### Quarter 2

* Attend an online course on Java
* Read a technical book on Java ([Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127932.Java_Concurrency_in_Practice?ac=1&from_search=true))
* Read a soft skills bool ([How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People))

### Quarter 3

* Attend a online course on multi-thread programming
* Read a technical book ([The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer))
* Read a soft skills book ([The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things))

### Quarter 4

* Attend a online course on multi-thread programming
* Read a technical book ([Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications))
* Read a soft skills book ([Rework](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6732019-rework))

## Customization

The previous template is just an example. We may have people that prefer a slower
pace, and people that demand a faster one. We may have people that don't like
to read and prefer to attend meetups. Rather than a template set in stone this
is just a guide that we should customize.

Having similar resources does have it advantages. The team starts to have common
vocabulary and it's easy to present references.

We should also have a plan for each area, and may be hard for a line manager
with a backend background to come up with a plan for a designer, frontender
or quality engineer. In this case we should ask for feedback and start testing
options. And keep fine tuning them.

# Summary

By following a plan we can reach the end of a year, look back, and clearly see
our path and everything we achieved. But we also need time to invest on this
and the company should help here.

I also try to push people out of their [comfort zone](/post/comfort-zone-index/)
by suggesting doing blog posts or even talks.

But all this is hard. It's hard to come up with a plan, and it's hard to actually
implement it. For example, I'm very good at motivating people to learn new things
and follow the training plan. But I actually lack a training plan of my own. In
this situation having a good mentor and peers may help a lot.

I do believe that the main point of having a training plan is to foster good
learning habits. And I do have some that I value: I read a book every month. I
iterate on technical books and _other_ books. Starting to read and keeping it
as a habit is something that I always try to push for.
