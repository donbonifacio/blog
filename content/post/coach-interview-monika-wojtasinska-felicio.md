I met [Monika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-felicio/) because [Ricardo
Fiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardofiel/) had referenced me as a team
leader. We talked about topics related with leading teams because Monika is
preparing training topics for leaders.

I really liked talking with her and felt that I could have so much to learn.
Being more focused on executing I sometimes feel that I lack in the theory part.

She works at [TEAMmatters](http://teammatters.eu/) where she helps companies
change for the better. I learned a lot on this interview and hope it will also
be useful for you.

> Hey Monika, can you give an intro to your background and about what you do?

My professional background is related to change & project management focused on
Organizational Development. I help a new generation of passionate leaders shape
strong, healthy and adaptive teams/organizations with the right people. 

I focus on building organizations with TRUST, with no politics, toxicity or
misplaced talents, but with a clear purpose and the right people, so they can
focus on their organizational adaptability and excellence. Organizations, where
most of the days people love going to work even if it's raining and return home
fulfilled, NOT exhausted or hating their jobs, BUT setting a positive example
for their kids that work can be meaningful and doesn't have to steal their "real
life”. 

One of my main inspirations for the "end result" of my work is a culture and a
structure that helps a company operate in the [Modern
Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/videos/modern-agile/) manner. 

I gained a vast part of my experience in a consulting company in Poland working
on different HR and strategic change management projects for multiple companies
– among others: Polish airlines, national railways, companies from the energy or
telco sector etc. but earlier I also worked in HR departments of an IT company,
a bank or a brewery;) I loved the consulting work, but its crazy intensity
(consulting is known for it) made me decide on a life change. I moved to
Portugal (also because of my Portuguese husband) and here I started working on
the similar matters, but independently. I facilitate workshops and manage change
projects. So far, my biggest pride comes from my almost 4-year cooperation with
[7Graus](https://www.7graus.com/) where we implement Modern Agile and we are heading for an ambitious
vision. 

> That's awesome Monika. How do you help leaders?

My role is similar to a "whisperer" or a coach. We could say I play “intellectual tennis” with them. ;) When requested, I offer a
second opinion on people-related topics and organizational dilemmas they have,
indicating a set of possible solutions. I both advise and execute them, if
needed, which may happen, for example, by facilitating workshops or through
individual coaching.

I help bring light to human behaviour and individual differences, which helps
manage diversity in the team and increase inclusion. At the same time, it helps
the leader to understand himself better and become more self-aware and confident
in his leadership style. I think that, along the way, the leader learns how to
be himself, and better. He doesn't need to “play the role of a leader”; trying
to be someone he’s not; he just needs to be authentic so people can **trust** him.
Because I believe that you can’t effectively lead from a position of power but
only through the authentic relationships you have with each member of your team.
That’s why I believe it’s so important for a leader to know himself and master
self-management first before he will try to better manage or influence others.
Only with good self-awareness, we can focus on building relationships and trust
with others - then, team management and leading changes are easier. And trust,
here, is fundamental. All this to build organizational with no politics,
toxicity or misplaced talents, but with a clear purpose and the right people, so
you can focus on your organizational adaptability, growth and excellence.

There is a quotation of John Adair that I very much agree with: _“You can be
appointed a manager... (but) you are not a leader **until** your appointment has
been ratified in the hearts and minds of those involved.”_

> What kind of changes do you help implement?

In general terms, I help to implement changes both at the individual and
cultural/organizational levels. By changes, I mean systemic solutions that
address problems like:

* How can we be more effective?
* How can we improve teamwork and team collaboration?
* How can we motivate/engage people in their work?
* How can we recognize efforts without a traditional, “toxic” appraisal system?
* How can we have more people with the Agile or growth mindset?
* How can we get people to take more responsibility/ownership?
* How can we encourage people to hold each other accountable?
* How can we transform to be more Agile?

How do I do it? I start with a diagnosis that helps me understand both the
leader and the team. I am usually there to make something work better. So it’s a
little bit like with a doctor - I listen to the symptoms but I also do some
additional analysis to confirm or verify the accuracy of the assumptions
(interviews or workshops with the team, surveys etc). Then, I suggest a set of
potential tools or ways to address the real cause of “the pain” and we execute
the “prescribed” treatment. I work in a very participative way, so I see myself
as a facilitator of change - helping the leader and the team co-create and adapt
the final solution to their specific context. I do it with them, not to them.

> How about working with leaders of leaders? Is the approach different?

Your question stopped me and made me curious. What would you think
could/should be different?:) Here, if it was a live conversation I would really
like to know your opinion and understand first what triggered you to ask the
question?? :)

And normally I would wait to listen to your answer first, however, following the
convention of the interview and not to make it look as avoidance to the answer
;) I can say that...:

_In my opinion what differentiates them most often is just the level they operate
on - more strategic vs operational - but not so much the consciousness they all
need to understand the concept of authentic leadership - who they are, who they
are not ;) and how to understand diversity of people, and navigate among
complexity of their interactions to get together to the common vision._

_What is your point of view on the leaders of the leaders and their challenges,

I have many tips and pointers as it’s exactly what I do! ;)

There are three things that I would like to clarify, so I will divide it into
parts.

### 1) Manager vs Leader

For me, speaking about a manager of a manager is a
different thing than speaking about a leader of a leader. It relates to John
Adair ’s quotation from earlier. I do believe that the essence of the role of
the leader is similar at both the operational and strategic level. To make
people feel like they are safe, matter and belong. What happens often is that
the higher the leader is in “the hierarchy” the more essential Emotional
Intelligence becomes to know how to win people's minds and hearts.

Therefore I see that a manager on the operational level has different tasks than
on the strategic level but, to be perceived as a leader, he has a similar path
to go through. What happens often is that a) the “kind of people” you lead are
different at each hierarchical level so the challenges are a bit different, and
b) also we as leaders, depending on our own personal development, see the
leadership and its challenges differently (we may be on different levels of
leadership, therefore some strategies or management tools we will perceive
differently).

Do you understand what I’m trying to convey?

I could elaborate in more details how it’s all linked again to leaders’
self-awareness and awareness of people’s nature, but I would just redirect those
more interested in the topic to find more about this in Bob Anderson’s work,
which I recommend, especially in relation to the point a) [Pathways to
Partnership](https://eu-es.leadershipcircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pathways-to-Partnership-Whitepaper-MAY2016.pdf) and for b) [5 level of leadership](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/there-are-5-stages-of-leadership-where-are-you-on-the-scale.html).


### 2)  Mentoring vs Coaching and Leadership

When you say that you may know how to
push someone to be better, I’m curious what exactly makes it different to lead a
developer over a manager?  What exactly makes you more confident with the
programmer? And what do you think you miss when it comes to the manager’s
development? Is it the fact that you were a developer yourself and you know how
it is to be in his shoes? That you have the “know-how” because it’s the field of
your expertise? If so, it might mean that, for now, you help people grow through
mentoring, because mentoring = I was there, I can share with you how I did it,
what I learned and what I believe can help you. It’s more like a student-teacher
relationship or father-son. It kind of requires that you have all the answers.

Coaching doesn't require you to have a similar experience or knowledge as the
person you are helping. Coaching = tell me where you want to go and I will help
you get there; I might not have been there myself but I can help you find out
what holds you back, how you will know that it works, what to do when you lose
motivation etc. In general, I can help you identify and follow a clear plan on
what you need to do to achieve the goal you desire, and all this will be done by
yourself.  The coach facilitates the process and brings accountability but the
coachee designs and executes the exact path.

In my opinion, coaching is a facilitation tool for the leader to help people
grow. It helps to keep a partnership between the leader and the team, based on
Adult-Adult relationship (not Parent-Child pattern). That being said, I think
that the leader doesn't need to know all the answers. Instead, I think that he
needs to ask the right questions so that his peers can find the answers
themselves so that they can bring ideas, create solutions and come up with their
own suggestions. I see the (servant) leader more as a sparring partner to
discuss ideas with, give feedback and encourage peers’ independence. I believe
and have observed that, in healthy organizations, development is the personal
responsibility of each person, not the responsibility of the leader or an HR
specialist.  So, instead of finding answers for the leaders you lead, I would
suggest to support them finding their own answers to questions like:

- “What does a good leader mean to you?”
- “If you could estimate how you see yourself as a leader, according to your
  definition in a scale of 1-10, where 1 is poor and 10 great - what would the
  right number be for you, right now?”
- “What makes you think this way/decide on this?”
- “How do you feel about the result?”
- “How would you like it to be? (When?)”
- “What do you need to be a better leader for +1 point in the scale?”
- “How can you get there?”
- “What more do you need to learn about to know exactly the path?”
- “Who can help you with it?”
- “How much time do you need for it?”
- “How will you know that you do a good job?”
- “How would you like me to help you?”
- “So, summarizing, what you want me to hold you accountable for is …. (what you
  agree before). Yes?”

We cannot make anybody grow if (s)he doesn't want to, if (s)he doesn't take
ownership over his/her development. By asking questions, you better understand
your peers’ awareness of what change they think they need, how much they want it
to happen and you can work on it. Most people don’t struggle with knowledge
about how to make changes but with motivation to implement them. By offering
them accountability and feedback along the process you already help immensely.
And if they need an expert in a field you don’t master - don’t feel bad. Nobody
knows everything! ;) We can be a mentor to few, but we can be a coach to many.
I believe that the leader is there to make people feel they are safe, matter and
belong, not to know everything.

What do you think is the leader’s role?

### 3) How to know that we are all aligned in values and have a healthy culture going on

This kind of evaluation is actually a starting point for my work!;) What works
best for me is the model of organizational health described by P. Lancioni.
Once, I created a 1-pager to summarize the whole model - you can download it
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3zWqod0Or8uWmxoUXNjalgyeVU/view). I believe that answering the 6 questions listed there should help you get
clarity on how cohesive the leadership team is. Also checking how you are doing
in terms of the 5 functions of the team (trust, openness to conflict,
commitment, accountability and attention to the results) should give you the
answer. It can be simply assessed even by a survey. However, you can achieve
better results with individual conversations discussing each of the aspects in
more details. Then, depending on the results, you focus on the aspect that
blocks development of the others.

Having an overview of all these aspects is very important in my opinion. That’s
why I believe that a good diagnosis is crucial to address the right actions in
the right order. And we need to remember that it’s all very contextual and
depends on the specificity of the organizational system design. Because people’s
behaviour is a result of the environment they are in and this is a system of
interactions, procedures and even proximity to the location(s) in/from which
people work.

So before scaling leadership and coaching, I would definitely say that it’s
better to make it work first, because you scale patterns. Make sure that your
current leadership team is the right role model of what you want to “multiply”.
If you are not sure yet if you have a healthy culture now, then you can make a
diagnosis to avoid passing “the virus” ;) Later, as any system of family or
friends - if any new member joins and sees others following similar rules he/she
will adapt or the system will reject it, because we all want to be safe, matter
and belong to the groups we value.

So before you scale, please check: maybe you need to fix the selection process
first to ensure that you hire and promote the right people to a leader’s role.
Or, you need to define the values first because they are not clear? Or maybe
your leaders compete with each other? They provoke too many conflicts or avoid
them? Or they don’t get feedback on how their work contributes to the company’s
goals? Or the leaders need to learn some coaching tools to foster more proactive
behaviours among team members?  You see? There are many possibilities.

If you give me more specific symptoms of what doesn't work I can give you a more
specific answer ;) For now, I would say it’s the general direction I would
suggest.

Does it answer your question? Or confuses more than clarifies? ;)

> Yes that answers my question and clarifies several things for me.

> On the document you referenced, you have smart organisations (technology,
> strategy, marketing, finance, ...) and healthy organisations (minimum politics
> and confusion, high degree of moral and productivity, low turnover, ...). Can
> an organisation be both smart and healthy? How do you sell the healthy
> mindset?

I think that we can only sell the healthy mindset to those that want it and are
ready to buy. ;)

An organization is like an organism. You can either exploit it to death or take
care of it so it can creatively keep exploring the world of opportunities.

Like every organism, organizations need balance. They need to be smart AND
healthy. In order to stay in the game, they need processes, results AND healthy
habits.

In many companies, there is a visible dominance of one of these dimensions. But,
as with every extreme, there are some risks attached to it. What I can see most
often is that organizations that focus only on the smart part (tasks and
results) end up with a pretty toxic work environment. Many people hate working
there, there is high internal competition, high rotation, low level of trust or
commitment and accountability level close to zero.

On the other hand, when a company focuses only on the internal issues (healthy
habits and well being of people) it may oversee external opportunities which,
after all, determine its existence in the business world.

Therefore, I believe that both elements are important. Balance is crucial.
Finding it is an active and continuous process. Because it's a living organism
with complex and dynamic interactions between all the parts - both processes and
people. A change in one part of the system brings a new impulse or energy to the
rest. It requires attentive observation. Continuously. Like in a family or a
relationship. We all evolve. And so do organizations.

In a way, it may sound a bit abstract, but I think this is exactly what is very
well pictured in the Modern Agile model. You can see there both the smart
aspects of your business (the horizontal axis with “Experiment and learn
rapidly” + “Deliver continuous value”) and the healthy social interactions
within the ecosystem of your organization (the vertical axis with “Make people
awesome” and “Safety as a prerequisite”).

In my opinion, balancing the two is super important because it determines the
overall vitality of the whole system. It also determines the quality of its
existence.

It's possible. And it can double your results. I witnessed it.  I have
contributed to organizational and cultural evolution that allows pursuing the
balance and I can share with you my final conclusion. It is only possible to do
that with a conscious and passionate leadership team that is ready to "buy" and
execute the healthy mindset. This is the critical condition, in my opinion.

What we can try to do is to make sure the leaders are aware of this duality
(smart vs healthy) and the benefits of balancing the two. Then, we can verify
their desire and willingness to experiment with it. Only then we can start
discussing how to do it.

> Amazing. I do agree with you and my way of seeing things is very aligned with

> to interview next?

Thank you Pedro for your feedback. It's very valuable for me. And thank you for
having me here.

About the topics I would expect - I like the variety of topics and people you
interview. I don't have any expectations. I read  every post with curiosity. My
only wish is that you keep it authentic, practical and inspirational - the way
you do it now (for as long as it brings you joy and satisfaction;)).

About a person to interview - how about [Pedro Pereira
Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donbonifacio/)? Maybe you could create an
AMA post (ask me anything) and this way we could interview you? :)

I can also suggest [Rui Marques](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruipedromarques/)
and [Rodrigo Dias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigodiaspt/).

For me, Rui is one of the best leaders and CEOs I have ever met and worked with.
Currently, he is the CEO of [7Graus](https://www.7graus.com/) and [Nex](http://www.nex.pt). He simply has what it takes to lead
people to great results - a strong belief in people's potential, sensitivity to
their needs and resourcefulness to help them set an environment in which they
can do what they are best in!

Rodrigo is very insightful and in my opinion, has so much wisdom in the field of
Organizational Development, combining engineering and psychological background,
that it might be good for others to know that it's possible to lead/organize
teams differently, as he does it at [Premium
Minds](http://www.premium-minds.com/).
