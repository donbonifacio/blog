I met [Ricardo Vladimiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardovladimiro/) a long
time ago when I was active in the gamedev Portuguese scene. I actually had
the pleasure of working with him in his startup where we developed several games.

At some point I went back to the web applications world and he started his journey
at [Miniclip](https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/) where he turned to data science and grew as a manager. He is
a good friend and a good mentor.

He also contributed to the blog with a guest post:

> Hey Vlad, Can you introduce yourself and talk a bit about what you do at
> Miniclip?

Hey!

My name is Ricardo Vladimiro aka Vlad and my official title at [Miniclip](https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/) is
Data Science Lead. The Data Science Team is sort of a spin-off from the initial
team I started, the Game Analytics and Data Science Team.

The objective of the Data Science Team is to research and develop Artificial
Intelligence and Data Science data products that turn the large amounts of data
we collect into value. This is a shift from using data as knowledge to support
decision into data as an asset to generate value.

On top of that, Miniclip has a number of initiatives in the management space
and I'm also heavily involved in training and coaching new managers and direct
reports that are identified as potential managers.

> Can you talk a little about how you train and coach new managers? Is it
> personalised, or do you have a standard template that you follow?

Miniclip has an official manager training program. It's ran by the People and
Organisation Team with an external company and it's fully structured. This
program is tailored for general soft skills and leadership of existing managers
at different levels of experience.

The management coaching that I'm involved in is different. For starters a
Miniclip employee does not have to be a manager to participate. Any individual
contributor that has shown interest or has been identified or any existing
manager that wants to develop new skills is welcomed. There's a structure in
the first 12 weeks but after that the topics for discussion are open and proposed
by the group.

None of them are personalised. However these programs created a community of
managers. This allows managers that excel in some specific area to be identified
which then allows for one to one ad-hoc coaching, help and discussion. There are
other positive implications like quicker discussion and adoption of new ideas but
as far as personalisation goes, the manager's community nurtures it.

> How do you identify potential managers? And what traits to you value on managers?

Potential managers are often identified by their current line managers. Although
this is the most common path it is also rather typical that individual
contributors approach their managers or managers that, like me, are known to be
involved in management coaching, to say they are interested in management. I
think that one of the good things of this process is that they have the opportunity
to understand what team management and leadership is in practice before
committing to a career change.

I don't think we ever discussed which traits are we actively look for to identify
potential managers but I can name some that are common on a Miniclip Manager and
that are often found in potential managers.

* **Accountability.** This is more about being a Minicliper than it is about
  being a Miniclip Manager, really. Since the culture is very open and supportive,
  being accountable becomes second nature because we don't care about pointing
  fingers and punishing mistakes but rather to help to solve problems.
* **Not being afraid to say "I don't know".** Ok... maybe this one is something
  that I personally look for. "I don't know" is one of the most frightening
  sentences to say. Children learn to articulate around admitting ignorance
  since a very young age. As adults we have to actively learn to say it. To me
  however, hearing someone saying "I don't know" means the person acknowledges
  that there's room for learning and improvement.
* **Understands company wide goals and is able to align others with those goals.**
  This is not a trait itself but a product of several different traits. When I'm
  told that someone has showed natural leadership skills I often ask "what do
  you mean?" It's very hard to name the skills so the answer I often get is a
  description of behaviours, like being able to mediate conflict or to manage
  people operationally in some project without any hierarchy involved. However
  what this translates to and is beneficial for the organisation is that this
  person is able to align other people to a common objective without the use of
  any role power.

Note that no trait is based on technical expertise. Becoming a manager is not
the next natural step up career wise. In fact I believe this mentality is
detrimental.

> We talked about how you find and train new managers. How about experienced
> managers? For example what would you require to level up?

There are many different answers to this depending on the context. We can look
at it from a pure theory perspective. Another option is to view it from each
organisation point of view, e.g. from Miniclip's perspective. Since these are
either too broad or too narrow, I'll give you my personal view on it.

As I see it, a proficient manager will look for continuous improvement to add
value to the organisation. From what I can observe this continuous improvement
is achieved in two different ways:

* The first is **operational improvements**. I'll take a wild guess that this
  is not at all surprising for anyone reading. These improvements focus mostly
  on the team. Every time a manager changes a process, removes a bottleneck,
  improves communication, this is an operational improvement. These improvements
  are the hallmark of a more traditional approach to management. Often the
  manager looks for knowledge of process and project management, coaching,
  mentoring, etc. As far as Miniclip is concerned these are often discussions
  that start with a manager asking another manager "have you ever done X?" or
  "I know you tackled X in the past, can you walk me through it?" To answer
  your question of what would I require to level up in these improvements, I
  would answer seek for help with other managers, especially the more experienced
  ones.
* The second way is through **innovation**. Unlike the first group, these
  managers look for processes, methodologies, views and ideas that don't exist
  in the organisation. They are the ones that create or bring something new to
  the organisation. While I expect that the majority of managers fall in the
  first way of improving, I strongly believe that a minority of managers, the
  ones that put a lot more effort and focus on management knowledge as one of
  their areas of expertise, should pursue and be empowered to try new things,
  whatever those are. Miniclip is a great example of this. Although the number
  of managers that fall in this category is small, they have the full support
  from the whole organisation. From localised experiments with new methodologies
  to set objectives to the creation of new teams, there's room for innovation.
  The management coaching that I referred previously and the two teams I started
  are great examples of this.

It's important to note that although innovation is "sexier" than good old
operational improvement, it is not more relevant in my opinion. It gets more
attention because it has the trademarks of things that are news worthy, like
"disruption". It is extremely risky (to put it mildly) to have more innovation
and disruption than good solid management improvement. It is also extremely
risky to have no innovation and disruption though. This said, a balance is
needed between the two and how that balance is attained depends on many factors.

> How do you know that the changes you are making are actually improvements?
> Naturally we can have a sense of how things are going on teams. I'm wondering
> if you have some more measurable ways of tracking performance. For individual
> contributors and for managers.

Let me start by arguing against "having a sense of how things are going". Having
a sense is opinion based and it is extremely difficult to reason about. As an
example, you can have a team that you, as a manager, feel is going great. You
infer that from individual contributors growing over time, from meeting deadlines
and reaching objectives. What if that team is a support team that acts as an
internal service provider and your team's objectives are not aligned with the
objectives of the team that it serves? What happens when a manager of one of
the teams your team serves has a sense that your team is not delivering what
they need, or in other words, that your team is not adding value to them? This
will be a very difficult conversation to have because it is mostly based on
opinion and lack of communication to begin with.

For this reason I steer away from opinion based sense or feeling and try my best
to align specific objectives with the business and/or other teams. And, in my
opinion, this is where we measure the impact. It's easier in theory than it is
in practice. Let me give you an example.

Imagine the following scenario, team A consistently misses delivery deadlines
they set. The easy solution is to establish a new methodology but lets assume
this is not the right thing to do. According to team A the delays happen due to
a communication problem with team B. To make things a bit more complex let's
assume that there's a team C that is responsible for the communication. Now we
have several objectives to be met:

* Team C has to deliver a solution for the communication problem and this solution
  has to meet the needs of both teams A and B
* Team A has to meet delivery deadlines after the communication problem is solved

The end improvement we are looking for is that team A delivers by the deadlines
they set which aligns them with the company objectives. But to get there we need
all the teams to establish objectives and priorities for a timely solution. No
matter how we look at it though, the end result we want to see is that team A
delivers on time without changing the methodology of estimating deadlines. We
can set this as a boolean or measure the rate of successful deliveries. If
management overhead is a concern, a boolean is sufficient, if not success rate
is preferable.

This example is very operational but the same logic can be applied to more
disruptive changes especially if you use OKRs which allow for much shorter,
focused and ambitious objectives.

> Could you elaborate on using OKRs for much shorter, focused and ambitions

OKRs are relatively new in Miniclip. Interestingly their introduction was what
I described earlier as innovation. There was a wide discussion on the topic of
objectives and one manager proposed to his own manager the use of OKRs. His
manager was involved in several of the objectives discussions and brought it up.
It spread to more managers that then advocated it to executives who gave full
support for it to be tested. It is currently being tested across several teams.

Each team is implementing OKRs differently. Some are using it as a form of
making objectives more agile disregarding some parts of it for either simplicity
or because those parts are not considered to add value at this point in time,
others are trying a full "by the book" implementation. Given this varied
experience, I'll answer your question in the context of the BI department in
general and the Data Science team in particular. The best way to illustrate is
to compare before and after.

Before OKRs we would plan the whole year. Inevitably this meant that Q1 was
filled with the most urgent objectives, Q2 and Q3 with the "next in line" and Q4
with the "nice to have" ones. The problem with this is that companies like
Miniclip are extremely agile and adapt very quickly to many external factors and
rightfully so. While all Q1 and most Q2 objectives were usually delivered, by Q3
and Q4 the agreed objectives were often irrelevant. We often found ourselves in
the position of excusing objectives not being met on the basis that there were
other more urgent unplanned objectives. This had another issue attached to it
which was the link between objectives and performance review.

With OKRs we solve most of these problems. We plan every quarter for the next
two quarters. I'm aware that this is not exactly the OKR way but both Data
Engineering and Data Science have projects that would not fit a one quarter
window. In true OKR fashion, we don't link performance to objectives which means
that in case the business needs us to adapt we happily adapt too even if we have
to adapt less given that we plan and review every quarter. The keyword is focused.
What we are saying when go through our quarterly OKRs is "this is the plan we
have to deliver maximum possible value in the next quarter". Shorter and ambitious
are a function of focused.

I have not found any difficulties in the communication with individual contributors
because they are part of the discussion. The typical process is the following.
All Miniclip employees are informed of the objectives and vision of Miniclip for
the following year. This is usually followed by many informal discussions between
the Head of BI, managers and individual contributors. These are held in one-on-ones,
staff and manager's meetings and it is a natural process where ideas, doubts and
answers go up and down over time. This then trickles down in the form of OKRs.
There are department level OKRs for the BI and those are owned by BI managers.
Then there are team level OKRs that can be owned by anyone. There are no individual
contributor OKRs although it is common for a team level OKR to be owned by
individual contributors.

I never really gave any thought on why this was an easy process to communicate
and implement but on hindsight I would say that it's extremely easy to communicate
about something to a person when that person is part of it.

> You said that you don't link objectives to performance. Can you elaborate a
> bit on how you do performance reviews?

This is fairly new and something I'm still debating and discussing. I'll share
my current point of view but take it with a grain of salt.

To start with I really like the vision of our Head of People and Organisation.
The starting point for performance is the tasks you execute and that you were
hired to do. Those are rarely, if ever, written down as objectives, e.g. as a
manager conducting performance reviews is part of my tasks but that was never
set as an objective. However failing to perform these tasks is basically the
definition of under performance. Then there is a layer around these tasks that
includes objectives but also other things like individual growth. The third and
final layer is what distinguishes the high performers of solid performers. It
deals with the context, e.g. a new initiative or delivering projects in
particularly difficult situations. From this description it is almost immediately
clear that objectives are just a part of one of the layers of performance.

How do I do performance reviews then?

First and foremost, although there are specific dates, namely the yearly
performance review and the six month check in, the vast majority of the review
is done in the weekly one on one meetings. These meetings allow consistent
alignment of each team member with the company goals by reinforcing behaviours
that are aligned with the company objectives and changing behaviours that aren't.
This is all about what the direct report is expected to do on a day to day basis,
so the first layer of performance and as far as performance review is concerned
they are rather informal. I enforce scheduled weekly one on ones as soon as I
have two direct reports. If we're failing at this level, performance reviews are
irrelevant.

Objectives are often linked with projects, learning and training. For these I
scheduled ad hoc meetings whenever necessary and review them there since I find
the six month gap to be to large. I've been aligning quarter meetings with the
OKR reviews. This allows for timely decisions.

And then there are the actual performance reviews and six month check in meetings.
These are for the most part a formality since all the performance review work
has been done over time. It is a good opportunity to a bit more in depth
reflection of the last 6 months or year and this is important and it is good to
have a fixed time to force ourselves to look at our work from hindsight but
performance wise, it's constantly being done.

> Your one-on-ones seem very interesting. What's your approach to one-on-ones?
> Do you plan for them? What value do you aim to take from them? What tips would
> you give to a new manager starting to do one-on-ones?

My current take on one-on-ones is very similar to the one explained in [Manager
Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/) and I recommend any manager, new or
experienced to check it out if they don't know it. A full disclaimer is in order
before I continue: I am not affiliated with Manager Tools or their services but
I am their customer for many years. My tip is to listen to Manager Tools Basics
and keep in mind that they work with major companies. For this reason it's more
important to understand the "why" and then adapt the "how" to your particular
scenario. Manager Tools "by the book" works better in large standard organisations.
For other organisations, like fast growth tech companies and startups the "how"
is, from my experience, too formal. The "why" is great though.

The #1 objective of one-on-ones is to develop a relationship with the direct
report. That is the value I wish to generate. It is not a reporting meeting, I
personally find individual report meetings unnecessary and a sign of
micro-management. One-on-ones are the time each direct report has my full
attention. I have heard direct reports I managed scheduling other meetings in
a way they didn't conflict with our one-on-ones because and I directly quote
"one-on-ones are sacred".

The problem of getting managers to have great one-on-ones is that it takes
some months to actually see the full benefit of these meetings, assuming they
are doing it right and focusing on relationship instead of reporting.

My "rules" for one-on-ones are:

1. Weekly pre-scheduled 30 minutes meetings. I won't reschedule a one-on-one
   meeting unless there's a meeting with a lot of people and my presence is
   absolutely necessary.
1. The direct report has the first block (10 to 20 minutes) to speak about
   whatever they want. And I literally mean whatever. It is difficult to express
   how important this is but in a nutshell the growth of my direct reports is
   not purely professional. Their life outside the office is at least as important
   as their life in the office for their professional productivity and growth.
   If they only want to talk about work it's fine too, of course and many actually
   do.
1. I have the remaining time for whatever I want to discuss.
1. I only have one-on-ones when I have more than one direct report. There are
   a number of reasons for this but for the most part when I have one direct
   report, the daily interaction is closer to a buddy system, hence the one-on-ones
   tend to have a lot of "like I told you yesterday".

All my direct reports know of all the rules, including the reasons for them.

I do prepare for one-on-ones. I have a notebook with a tab for each direct report.
Every point that appears over the week that I want to discuss is written there.
The day of the one-on-one I review my notes of the previous one-on-one and the
new notes and go to the meeting.

One-on-ones are a huge topic. One that is too complex to explain in this format
I think but I hope I got enough of the basics.

> This interview was great and I learned a lot. Thanks for participating. :)
> To close this interview, what topics would you expect to see in a blog about
> engineering management? And do you have someone to suggest for a next interview?

Thank you, I have a lot of fun answering the questions.

Regarding topics for the blog, I'd love to read more about adapting to technology
changes.

As far as suggestions, there are two people with whom I discuss management for
a long time. The first one is [Ricardo Sousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sousarc/). We are friends for almost 30 years
and we've discussing and learning management from each other for almost 20 of
those years. The second is [Gilberto Medeiros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilberto-medeiros-0538b14/) who was the starter of the management
coaching initiative at Miniclip and is one of the best managers I had the
opportunity to work with.
