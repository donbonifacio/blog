I have been a professional developer since 2006 after graduating with a CS
degree from Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa.

I'm an engineer at heart with a passion to build, lead and serve high-performance
teams trough excellence in hiring, team culture development, personal development
and coaching, as well as a constant push for high quality deliverables and
DevOps engineering practices.

I aim to be hands-on whenever needed and I'm always on the lookout for better
ways to improve processes, increase productivity and solve root problems.
